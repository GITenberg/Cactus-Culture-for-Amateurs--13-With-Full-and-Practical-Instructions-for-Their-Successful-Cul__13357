  <p>HE idea that Cactuses were seldom seen in English gardens, because
  so little was known about their cultivation and management, suggested
  to the Publisher of this book that a series of chapters on the best
  kinds, and how to grow them successfully, would be useful. These
  chapters were written for and published in <i>The Bazaar,</i> in 1885
  and following years. Some alterations and additions have been made,
  and the whole is now offered as a thoroughly practical and
  descriptive work on the subject.</p>

  <p>The descriptions are as simple and complete as they could be made;
  the names here used are those adopted at Kew; and the cultural
  directions are as full and detailed as is necessary. No species or
  variety is omitted which is known to be in cultivation, or of
  sufficient interest to be introduced. The many excellent figures of
  Cactuses in the <i>Botanical Magazine</i> (Bot. Mag.) are referred to
  under each species described, except in those cases where a complete
  figure is given in this book. My claims to be heard as a teacher in
  this department are based on an experience of ten years in the care
  and cultivation of the large collection of Cactuses at Kew.</p>

  <p>Whatever the shortcomings of my share of the work may be, I feel
  certain that the numerous and excellent illustrations which the
  Publisher has obtained for this book cannot fail to render it
  attractive, and, let us also hope, contribute something towards
  bringing Cactuses into favour with horticulturists, professional as
  well as amateur.</p>

  <p>HE Cactus family is not popular among English horticulturists in
  these days, scarcely half a dozen species out of about a thousand
  known being considered good enough to be included among favourite
  garden plants. Probably five hundred kinds have been, or are, in
  cultivation in the gardens of the few specialists who take an
  interest in Cactuses; but these are practically unknown in English
  horticulture. It is not, however, very many years ago that there was
  something like a Cactus mania, when rich amateurs vied with each
  other in procuring and growing large collections of the rarest and
  newest kinds.</p>

  <p>"About the year 1830, Cacti began to be specially patronised by
  several rich plant amateurs, of whom may be mentioned the Duke of
  Bedford, who formed a fine collection at Woburn Abbey, the Duke of
  Devonshire, and Mr. Harris, of Kingsbury. Mr. Palmer, of Shakelwell,
  had become possessed of Mr. Haworth's collection, to which he greatly
  added by purchases; he, however, found his rival in the Rev. H.
  Williams, of Hendon, who formed a fine and select collection, and, on
  account of the eagerness of growers to obtain the new and rare
  plants, high prices were given for them, ten, twelve, and even twenty
  and thirty guineas often being given for single plants of the
  Echinocactus. Thus private collectors were induced to forward from
  their native countries&mdash;chiefly from Mexico and
  Chili&mdash;extensive collections of Cacti." (quoting J. Smith.
  A.L.S., ex-Curator of the Royal Gardens. Kew).</p>

  <p>This reads like what might be written of the position held now in
  England by the Orchid family, and what has been written of Tulips and
  other plants whose popularity has been great at some time or other.
  Why have Cactuses gone out of favour? It is impossible to give any
  satisfactory answer to this question. No doubt they belong to that
  class of objects which is only popular whilst it pleases the eye or
  tickles the fancy; and the eye and the fancy having tired of it, look
  to something different.</p>

  <p>The general belief with respect to Cactuses is that they are all
  wanting in beauty, that they are remarkable only in that they are
  exceedingly curious in form, and as a rule very ugly. It is true that
  none of them possess any claims to gracefulness of habit or elegance
  of foliage, such as are usual in popular plants, and, when not in
  flower, very few of the Cactuses would answer to our present ideas of
  beauty with respect to the plants we cultivate. Nevertheless, the
  stems of many of them (see <a href="images/front.jpg">Frontispiece,
  Fig. 1</a>) are peculiarly attractive on account of their strange,
  even fantastic, forms, their spiny clothing, the absence of leaves,
  except in very few cases, and their singular manner of growth. To the
  few who care for Cactuses there is a great deal of beauty, even in
  these characters, although perhaps the eye has to be educated up to
  it.</p>

  <p>If the stems are more curious than beautiful, the flowers of the
  majority of the species of Cactuses are unsurpassed, as regards size
  and form, and brilliancy and variety in colour, by any other family
  of plants, not even excluding Orchids. In size some of the flowers
  equal those of the Queen of Water Lilies <i>(Victoria regia),</i>
  whilst the colours vary from the purest white to brilliant crimson
  and deep yellow. Some of them are also deliciously fragrant. Those
  kinds which expand their huge blossoms only at night are particularly
  interesting; and in the early days of Cactus culture the flowering of
  one of these was a great event in English gardens.</p>

  <p>Of the many collections of Cactuses formed many years ago in
  England, that at Kew is the only one that still exists. This
  collection has always been rich in the number of species it
  contained; at the present time the number of kinds cultivated there
  is about 500. Mr. Peacock, of Hammersmith, also has a large
  collection of Cactuses, many of which he has at various times
  exhibited in public places, such as the Crystal Palace, and the large
  conservatory attached to the Royal Horticultural Society's Gardens at
  South Kensington. Other smaller collections are cultivated in the
  Botanic Gardens at Oxford, Cambridge, Glasnevin, and Edinburgh.</p>

  <p>A great point in favour of the plants of the Cactus family for
  gardens of small size, and even for window gardening&mdash;a modest
  phase of plant culture which has made much progress in recent
  years&mdash;is the simpleness of their requirements under
  cultivation. No plants give so much pleasure in return for so small
  an amount of attention as do these. Their peculiarly tough-skinned
  succulent stems enable them to go for an extraordinary length of time
  without water; indeed, it may be said that the treatment most
  suitable for many of them during the greater portion of the year is
  such as would be fatal to most other plants. Cactuses are children of
  the dry barren plains and mountain sides, living where scarcely any
  other form of vegetation could find nourishment, and thriving with
  the scorching heat of the sun over their heads, and their roots
  buried in the dry, hungry soil, or rocks which afford them anchorage
  and food.</p>

  <p>In beauty and variety of flowers, in the remarkable forms of their
  stems, in the simple nature of their requirements, and in the other
  points of special interest which characterise this family, and which
  supply the cultivator and student with an unfailing source of
  pleasure and instruction, the Cactus family is peculiarly rich.</p>

  <h3>BOTANICAL CHARACTERS.</h3>

  <div class="figleft">
    <img src="images/fancy_A.gif" width="54" height="113" alt="A" />
  </div><br />

  <p>LTHOUGH strictly botanical information may be considered as
  falling outside the limits of a treatise intended only for the
  cultivator, yet a short account of the principal characters by which
  Cactuses are grouped and classified may not be without interest.</p>

  <p>From the singular form and succulent nature of the whole of the
  Cactus family, it might be inferred that, in these characters alone,
  we have reliable marks of relationship, and that it would be safe to
  call all those plants Cactuses in which such characters are manifest.
  A glance at some members of other families will, however, soon show
  how easily one might thus be mistaken. In the Euphorbias we find a
  number of kinds, especially amongst those which inhabit the dry,
  sandy plains of South Africa, which bear a striking resemblance to
  many of the Cactuses, particularly the columnar ones and the
  Rhipsalis. (The Euphorbias all have milk-like sap, which, on pricking
  their stems or leaves, at once exudes and thus reveals their true
  character. The sap of the Cactuses is watery). Amongst Stapelias,
  too, we meet with plants which mimic the stem characters of some of
  the smaller kinds of Cactus. Again, in the Cactuses themselves we
  have curious cases of plant mimicry; as, for instance, the Rhipsalis,
  which looks like a bunch of Mistletoe, and the Pereskia, the leaves
  and habit of which are more like what belong to, say, the Gooseberry
  family than to a form of Cactus. From this it will be seen that
  although these plants are almost all succulent, and curiously formed,
  they are by no means singular in this respect.</p>

  <p>The characters of the order are thus defined by botanists:
  Cactuses are either herbs, shrubs, or trees, with soft flesh and
  copious watery juice. Root woody, branching, with soft bark. Stem
  branching or simple, round, angular, channelled, winged, flattened,
  or cylindrical; sometimes clothed with numerous tufts of spines which
  vary in texture, size, and form very considerably; or, when
  spineless, the stems bear numerous dot-like scars, termed areoles.
  Leaves very minute, or entirely absent, falling off very early,
  except in the Pereskia and several of the Opuntias, in which they are
  large, fleshy, and persistent. Flowers solitary, except in the
  Pereskia, and borne on the top or side of the stem; they are composed
  of numerous parts or segments; the sepals and petals are not easily
  distinguished from each other; the calyx tube is joined to, or
  combined, with the ovary, and is often covered with scale-like sepals
  and hairs or spines; the calyx is sometimes partly united so as to
  form a tube, and the petals are spread in regular whorls, except in
  the Epiphyllum. Stamens many, springing from the side of the tube or
  throat of the calyx, sometimes joined to the petals, generally equal
  in length; anthers small and oblong. Ovary smooth, or covered with
  scales and spines, or woolly, one-celled; style simple, filiform or
  cylindrical, with a stigma of two or more spreading rays, upon which
  are small papillae. Fruit pulpy, smooth, scaly, or spiny, the pulp
  soft and juicy, sweet or acid, and full of numerous small, usually
  black, seeds.</p>

  <p><b>Tribe I</b>.&mdash;<i>Calyx tube produced beyond the Ovary.
  Stem covered with Tubercles, or Ribs, bearing Spines.</i></p>

  <p>1. MELOCACTUS. Stem globose; flowers in a dense cap-like head,
  composed of layers of bristly wool and slender spines, amongst which
  the small flowers are developed. The cap is persistent, and increases
  annually with the stem.</p>

  <p>2. MAMILLARIA. Stems short, usually globose, and covered with
  tubercles or mammae, rarely ridged, the apex bearing spiny cushions;
  flowers mostly in rings round the stem.</p>

  <p>3. PELECYPHORA. Stem small, club-shaped; tubercles in spiral rows,
  and flattened on the top, where are two rows of short scale-like
  spines.</p>

  <p>4. LEUCHTENBERGIA. Stem naked at the base; tubercles on the upper
  part large, fleshy, elongated, three-angled, bearing at the apex a
  tuft of long, thin, gristle-like spines.</p>

  <p>5. ECHINOCACTUS. Stem short, ridged, spiny; calyx tube of the
  flower large, bell-shaped; ovary and fruit scaly.</p>

  <p>6. DISCOCACTUS. Stem short; calyx tube thin, the throat filled by
  the stamens; ovary and fruit smooth.</p>

  <p>7. CEREUS. Stem often long and erect, sometimes scandent,
  branching, ridged or angular; flowers from the sides of the stem;
  calyx tube elongated and regular; stamens free.</p>

  <p>8. PHYLLOCACTUS. Stem flattened, jointed, and notched; flowers
  from the sides, large, having long, thin tubes and a regular
  arrangement of the petals.</p>

  <p>9. EPIPHYLLUM. Stem flattened, jointed; joints short; flowers from
  the apices of the joints; calyx tube short; petals irregular, almost
  bilabiate.</p>

  <p><b>Tribe II.</b>&mdash;<i>Calyx-tube not produced beyond the
  Ovary. Stem branching, jointed.</i></p>

  <p>10. RHIPSALIS. Stem thin and rounded, angular, or flattened,
  bearing tufts of hair when young; flowers small; petals spreading;
  ovary smooth; fruit a small pea-like berry.</p>

  <p>11. OPUNTIA. Stem jointed, joints broad and fleshy, or rounded;
  spines barbed; flowers large; fruit spinous, large, pear-like.</p>

  <p>12. PERESKIA. Stem woody, spiny, branching freely; leaves fleshy,
  large, persistent; flowers medium in size, in panicles on the ends of
  the branches.</p>

  <p>The above is a key to the genera on the plan of the most recent
  botanical arrangement, but for horticultural purposes it is necessary
  that the two genera Echinopsis and Pilocereus should be kept up. They
  come next to Cereus, and are distinguished as follows:</p>

  <p>ECHINOPSIS. Stem as in Echinocactus, but the flowers are produced
  low down from the side of the stem, and the flower tube is long and
  curved.</p>

  <p>PILOCEREUS. Stem tall, columnar, bearing long silky hairs as well
  as spines; flowers in a head on the top of the stem, rarely
  produced.</p>

  <p>With the aid of this key anyone ought to be able to make out to
  what genus a particular Cactus belongs, and by referring to the
  descriptions of the species, he may succeed in making out what the
  plant is.</p>

  <p>For the classification of Cactuses, botanists rely mainly on their
  floral organs and fruit. We may, therefore, take a plant of
  Phyllocactus, with which most of us are familiar, and, by observing
  the structure of its flowers, obtain some idea of the botanical
  characters of the whole order.</p>

  <p>Phyllocactus has thin woody stems and branches composed of
  numerous long leaf-like joints, growing out of one another, and
  resembling thick leaves joined by their ends. Along the sides of
  these joints there are numerous notches, springing from which are the
  large handsome flowers. On looking carefully, we perceive that the
  long stalk-like expansion is not a stalk, because it is above the
  seed vessel, which is, of course, a portion of the flower itself. It
  is a hollow tube, and contains the long style or connection between
  the seed vessel and the stigma, <i>a</i> (Fig. 2). This tube, then,
  must be the calyx, and the small scattered scale-like bodies,
  <i>b</i> (Fig. 2), which clothe the outside, are really calyx
  lobes.</p>

    "FLOWER OF PHYLLOCACTUS, CUT LENGTHWISE" />

    <p>FIG. 2.&mdash;FLOWER OF PHYLLOCACTUS, CUT LENGTHWISE</p>

    <p><i>a,</i> Calyx Tube. <i>b,</i> Calyx Lobes. <i>c,</i> Ditto,
    assuming the form of Petals. <i>d,</i> Stamens. <i>e,</i> Style.
    <i>f,</i> Ovary or Seed Vessel.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Nearer the top of the flower, these calyx lobes are better
  developed, until, surrounding the corolla, we find them assuming the
  form and appearance of petals, <i>c</i> (Fig. 2). The corolla is
  composed of a large number of long strap-shaped pointed petals, very
  thin and delicate, often beautifully coloured, and generally
  spreading outwards. Springing from the bases of these petals, we find
  the stamens, <i>d</i> (Fig. 2), a great number of them, forming a
  bunch of threads unequal in length, and bearing on their tips the
  hay-seed-like anthers, which are attached to the threads by one of
  their points. The style is a long cylindrical body, <i>e</i> (Fig.
  2), which stretches from the ovary to the top of the flower, where it
  splits into a head of spreading linear rays, &frac12; in. length.
  When the flower withers, the seed vessel, <i>f</i> (Fig. 2), remains
  on the plant and expands into a large succulent fruit, inside which
  is a mass of pulpy matter, inclosing the numerous, small, black, bony
  seeds.</p>

  <p>It must not be supposed that all the genera into which Cactuses
  are divided are characterised by large flowers such as would render
  their study as easy as the genus taken as an illustration. In some,
  such for instance as the Rhipsalis, the flowers are small, and
  therefore less easy to dissect than those of Phyllocactus.</p>

  <p>The stems of Cactuses show a very wide range of variation in size,
  in form, and in structure. In size, we have the colossal <i>Cereus
  giganteus,</i> whose straight stems when old are as firm as iron, and
  rise with many ascending arms or rear their tall leafless trunks like
  ships' masts to a height of 60 ft. or 70 ft. From this we descend
  through a multitude of various shapes and sizes to the tiny tufted
  Mamillarias, no larger than a lady's thimble, or the creeping
  Rhipsalis, which lies along the hard ground on which it grows, and
  looks like hairy caterpillars. In form, the variety is very
  remarkable. We have the Mistletoe Cactus, with the appearance of a
  bunch of Mistletoe, berries and all; the Thimble Cactus; the Dumpling
  Cactus; the Melon Cactus; the Turk's cap Cactus; the Rat's-tail
  Cactus; the Hedgehog Cactus; all having a resemblance to the things
  whose names they bear. Then there is the Indian Fig, with branches
  like battledores, joined by their ends; the Epiphyllum and
  Phyllocactus, with flattened leaf-like stems; the columnar spiny
  Cereus, with deeply channelled stems and the appearance of immense
  candelabra. Totally devoid of leaves, and often skeleton-like in
  appearance, these plants have a strange look about them, which is
  suggestive of some fossilised forms of vegetation belonging to the
  past ages of the mastodon, the elk, and the dodo, rather than to the
  living things of to-day.</p>

  <p>By far the greater part of the species of Cactuses belong to the
  group with tall or elongated stems. "It is worthy of remark that as
  the stems advance in age the angles fill up, or the articulations
  disappear, in consequence of the slow growth of the woody axis and
  the gradual development of the cellular substance; so that, at the
  end of a number of years, all the branches of Cactuses, however
  angular or compressed they originally may have been, become trunks
  that are either perfectly cylindrical, or which have scarcely any
  visible angles."</p>

  <p>A second large group is that of which the Melon and Hedgehog
  Cactuses are good representatives, which have sphere-shaped stems,
  covered with stout spines. We have hitherto spoken of the Cactuses as
  being without leaves, but this is only true of them when in an old or
  fully-developed state. On many of the stems we find upon their
  surface, or angles, small tubercles, which, when young, bear tiny
  scale-like leaves. These, however, soon wither and fall off, so that,
  to all appearance, leaves are never present on these plants. There is
  one exception, however, in the Barbadoes Gooseberry (Pereskia), which
  bears true and persistent leaves; but these may be considered
  anomalous in the order.</p>

  <p>The term "succulent" is applied to Cactuses because of the large
  proportion of cellular tissue, <i>i.e.,</i> flesh, of their stems, as
  compared with the woody portion. In some of them, when young, the
  woody system appears to be altogether absent, and they have the
  appearance of a mass of fleshy matter, like a vegetable marrow. This
  succulent mass is protected by a tough skin, often of leather-like
  firmness, and almost without the little perforations called breathing
  and evaporating pores, which in other plants are very numerous. This
  enables the Cactuses to sustain without suffering the full ardour of
  the burning sun and parched-up nature of the soil peculiar to the
  countries where they are native. Nature has endowed Cactuses with a
  skin similar to what she clothes many succulent fruits with, such as
  the Apple, Plum, Peach, &amp;c., to which the sun's powerful rays are
  necessary for their growth and ripening.</p>

  <p>The spiny coat of the majority of Cactuses is no doubt intended to
  serve as a protection from the wild animals inhabiting with them the
  sterile plains of America, and to whom the cool watery flesh of the
  Cactus would otherwise fall a prey. Indeed, these spines are not
  sufficient to prevent some animals from obtaining the watery insides
  of these plants, for we read that mules and wild horses kick them
  open and greedily devour their succulent flesh. It has also been
  suggested that the spines are intended to serve the plants as a sort
  of shade from the powerful sunshine, as they often spread over and
  interlace about the stems.</p>

  <h3>CULTIVATION.</h3>

  <div class="figleft">
    <img src="images/fancy_B.gif" width="55" height="118" alt="B" />
  </div><br />

  <p>Y noting the conditions in which plants are found growing in a
  natural state, we obtain some clue to their successful management,
  when placed under conditions more or less artificial; and, in the
  case of Cactuses, knowledge of this kind is of more than ordinary
  importance. In the knowledge that, with only one or two exceptions,
  they will not exist in any but sunny lands, where, during the greater
  part of the year, dry weather prevails, we perceive what conditions
  are likely to suit them when under cultivation in our
  plant-houses.</p>

  <p>Cactuses are all American (using this term for the whole of the
  New World) with only one or two exceptions (several species of
  Rhipsalis have been found wild in Africa, Madagascar, and Ceylon),
  and, broadly speaking, they are mostly tropical plants,
  not-withstanding the fact of their extending to the snow-line on some
  of the Andean Mountains of Chili, where several species of the
  Hedgehog Cactus were found by Humboldt on the summit of rocks whose
  bases were planted in snow. In California, in Mexico and Texas, in
  the provinces of Central and South America, as far south as Chili,
  and in many of the islands contiguous to the mainland, the Cactus
  family has become established wherever warmth and drought, such as
  its members delight in, allowed them to get established. In many of
  the coast lands, they occur in very large numbers, forming forests of
  strange aspect, and giving to the landscape a weird, picturesque
  appearance. Humboldt, in his "Views of Nature," says: "There is
  hardly any physiognomical character of exotic vegetation that
  produces a more singular and ineffaceable impression on the mind of
  the traveller than an arid plain, densely covered with columnar or
  candelabra-like stems of Cactuses, similar to those near Cumana, New
  Barcelona, Cora. and in the province of Jaen de Bracamoros." This
  applies also to some of the small islands of the West Indies, the
  hills or mountains of which are crowned with these curious-looking
  plants, whose singular shapes are alone sufficient to remind the
  traveller that he has reached an American coast; for these Cactuses
  are as peculiar a feature of the New World as the Heaths are in the
  Old, or as Eucalypti are in Australia.</p>

  <p>Although the Cactus order is, in its distribution by Nature,
  limited to the regions of America, yet it is now represented in
  various parts of the Old World by plants which are apparently as wild
  and as much at home as when in their native countries.</p>

  <p>The Indian Figs are, perhaps, the most widely distributed of
  Cactuses in the Old World&mdash;a circumstance due to their having
  been introduced for the sake of their edible fruits, and more
  especially for the cultivation of the cochineal insect. In various
  places along the shores of the Mediterranean, and in South Africa,
  and even in Australia, the Opuntias have become naturalised, and
  appear like aboriginal inhabitants. It is, however, only in warm
  sunny regions that the naturalisation of these plants is
  possible.</p>

  <p>From these facts, we are able to form some general idea of the
  conditions suitable for Cactuses when cultivated in our greenhouses;
  for, although we seldom have, or care to have, any but diminutive
  specimens of many of these plants as compared with their appearance
  when wild, yet we know that the same conditions as regards heat,
  light, and moisture are necessary for small Cactuses as for
  full-grown ones.</p>

  <p>Although the places in which Cactuses naturally abound are, for
  the greater portion of the year, very dry and warm, heavy rains are
  more or less frequent during certain periods, and these, often
  accompanied by extreme warmth and bright sunshine, have an
  invigorating and almost forcing effect on the growth of Cactuses. It
  is during this rainy period that the whole of the growth is made, and
  new life is, as it were, given to the plant, its reservoir-like
  structure enabling it to store up a large amount of food and
  moisture, so that on the return of dry weather the safety of the
  plant is insured.</p>

  <p>It is to the management of Cactuses in a small state, such as is
  most convenient for our plant-houses, and not to the cultivation of
  those colossal species referred to above, that the instructions given
  here will be for the most part devoted; but, as in the case of almost
  every one of our cultivated plants, it is important to the cultivator
  to know something of the conditions which Nature has provided for
  Cactuses in those lands where they are native.</p>

  <p>There is nothing in the nature or the requirements of Cactuses
  that should render their successful management beyond the means of
  anyone who possesses a small, heated greenhouse, or even a window
  recess to which sunlight can be admitted during some portion of the
  day. In large establishments, such as Kew, it is possible to provide
  a spacious house specially for the cultivation of an extensive
  collection, where many of them may attain a good size before becoming
  too big. And it will be evident that where a house such as that at
  Kew can be afforded, much more satisfactory results may generally be
  obtained, than if plants have to be provided for in a house
  containing various other plants, or in the window of a dwelling-room.
  Apart altogether from size, it is, however, possible to grow a
  collection of Cactuses, and to grow them well, in a house of small
  dimensions&mdash;given the amount of sunlight and heat which are
  required by these plants. We sometimes see Cactuses&mdash;specimens,
  too, of choice and rare kinds&mdash;which have been reared in a
  cottager's window or in a small greenhouse, and which in health and
  beauty have at least equalled what has been accomplished in the most
  elaborately prepared houses. It may be said that these successes,
  under conditions of the most limited kind, are accidental rather than
  the result of properly understood treatment; but however they have
  been brought about, these instances of good cultivation are
  sufficient to show that success is possible, even where the means are
  of the simplest or most restricted kind. Whether it be in a large
  house, fitted with the best arrangements, or in the window of the
  cottager, the conditions essential to the successful cultivation of
  Cactuses are practically the same.</p>

  <p><b>In Wardian Cases.</b>&mdash;Many of our readers will be
  acquainted with the neat little glass cases, like greenhouses in
  shape, and fitted up in much the same way, which are sometimes to be
  seen in our markets, filled with a collection of miniature Cactuses.
  To the professional gardener, these cases are playthings, and are
  looked upon by him as bearing about the same relation to gardening as
  a child's doll's house does to housekeeping. Not-withstanding this,
  they are the source of much interest, and even of instruction, to
  many of the millions to whom a greenhouse or serious gardening is an
  impossibility. In these little cases&mdash;for which we are indebted
  to Mr. Boller, a dealer in Cactaceous plants&mdash;it is possible to
  grow a collection of tiny Cactuses for years, if only the operations
  of watering, potting, ventilating, and other matters connected with
  ordinary plant growing, are properly attended to.</p>

  <p><b>In Window Recesses.</b>&mdash;In the window recess larger
  specimens may be grown, and here it is possible to grow and flower
  successfully many of the plants of the Cactus family. In a window
  with a south aspect, and which lights a room where fires are kept, at
  least during cold weather, specimens of Phyllocactus, <i>Cereus
  flagelliformis,</i> Epiphyllum, and, in fact, of almost every kind of
  Cactus, are sometimes to be met with even in England; whilst in
  Germany they are as popular among the poorer classes as the Fuchsia,
  the Pelargonium, and the Musk are with us. One of the commonest of
  Cactuses in the latter country is the Rat's-tail Cactus <i>(Cereus
  flagelliformis),</i> and it is no unusual thing to see a large window
  of a cottager's dwelling thickly draped on the inside with the long,
  tail-like growths and handsome rose-coloured flowers of this plant.
  This is only one among dozens of species, all equally useful for
  window gardening, and all as interesting and beautiful as those above
  described.</p>

  <p><b>In Greenhouses.</b>&mdash;For the greenhouse proper, Cactuses
  are well adapted, either as the sole occupants or as suitable for
  such positions as are afforded by shelves or baskets placed near the
  roof glass. If the greenhouse is not fitted with heating
  arrangements, then, by selecting only those species of Cactus that
  are known to thrive in a position where, during winter, they are kept
  safe out of the reach of frost (of which a large number are known) a
  good collection of these plants may be grown. In heated structures
  the selection of kinds may be made according to the space available,
  and to the conditions under which they will be expected to grow. Fig.
  3 represents a section of a house for Cactuses, which will afford a
  good idea of the kind of structure best suited for them. The aspect
  is due south.</p>

    <p>FIG. 3.&mdash;SECTION OF HOUSE FOR CACTUSES&mdash;A,A, Hot-water
    Pipes; B,B, Ventilators</p>
  </div>

  <p>When grown on their own roots, the Epiphyllums, as well as the
  pendent-growing kinds of Rhipsalis, and several species of Cereus,
  may be placed in baskets and suspended from the roof. The baskets
  should be lined with thin slices of fibrous peat, and the whole of
  the middle filled with the compost recommended for these plants under
  "Soil". When well managed, some very pretty objects are formed by the
  Epiphyllums grown as basket plants. The climbing Cactuses are usually
  planted in a little mound composed of loam and brick rubble, and
  their stems either trained along rafters or allowed to run up the
  back wall of a greenhouse, against which they root freely, and are
  generally capable of taking care of themselves with very little
  attention from the gardener.</p>

  <p><b>In Frames.</b>&mdash;For cultivation in frames, the conditions
  are the same as for greenhouses. Even when grown in the latter, it
  will be found conducive to the health and flowering of the plants if,
  during the summer months, they can be placed in a frame with a south
  aspect, removing them back to the house again on the decline of
  summer weather. Wherever the place selected for Cactuses may be,
  whether in a large plant-house, or a frame, or a window, it is of
  vital importance to the plants that the position should be exposed to
  bright sunshine during most of the day. Without sunlight, they can no
  more thrive than a Pelargonium could without water. In Germany, many
  growers of almost all the kinds of Cactuses place their young plants
  in frames, which are prepared as follows: In April or May a hot-bed
  of manure and leaves is prepared, and a frame placed upon it, looking
  south. Six inches of soil is put on the top of the bed, and in this,
  as soon as the temperature of the bed has fallen to about 70 deg.,
  the young plants are placed in rows. The frames are kept close even
  in bright weather, except when there is too much moisture inside, and
  the plants are syringed twice daily in dry, hot weather. The growth
  they make under this treatment is astonishing. By the autumn the
  plants are ready to be ripened by exposure to sun and air, and in
  September they are lifted, planted in pots, and sent to market for
  sale. This method may be adopted in England, and if carefully
  managed, the growth the plants would make would far exceed anything
  ever accomplished when they are kept permanently in pots.</p>

  <p><b>Out-of-doors.</b>&mdash;There are some kinds which may be grown
  out of doors altogether, if planted on a sunny, sheltered position,
  on a rockery. The most successful plan is that followed at Kew, where
  a collection of the hardier species is planted in a rockery composed
  of brick rubble and stones. During summer the plants are exposed; but
  when cold weather and rains come, lights are placed permanently over
  the rockery, and in this way it is kept comparatively dry. No
  fire-heat or protection of any other kind is used, and the vigorous
  growth, robust health, and floriferousness of the several species are
  proofs of the fitness of the treatment for this class of plants.</p>

  <p>In any garden where a few square yards in a sunny, well-drained
  position can be afforded for a raised rockery, the hardy Cactuses may
  be easily managed. To make a suitable rockery, proceed as follows:
  Find a position against the south wall of a house, greenhouse, or
  shed, and against this wall construct a raised rockery of brick
  rubble, lime rubbish, stones (soft sandstone, if possible), and
  fibrous loam. The rockery when finished should be, say, 4 ft. wide,
  and reach along the wall as far as required; the back of the rockery
  would extend about 2 ft. above the ground level, and fall towards the
  front. Fix in the wall, 1 ft. or so above the rockery, a number of
  hooks at intervals all along, to hold in position lights sufficiently
  long to cover the rockery from the wall to the front, where they
  could be supported by short posts driven in the ground. The lights
  should be removed during summer to some shed, and brought out for use
  on the approach of winter. Treated in this manner, the following
  hardy species could not fail to be a success:</p><i>Opuntia
  Rafinesquii</i> and var. <i>arkansana, O. vulgaris, O. brachyarthra,
  O. Picolominiana, O. missouriensis, O. humilis, Cereus Fendleri, C.
  Engelmanni, C. gonacanthus, C. phoeniceus, Echinocactus Simpsoni, E.
  Pentlandii, Mamillaria vivipara.</i>

  <p>Having briefly pointed out the various positions in which Cactuses
  may be cultivated successfully, we will now proceed to treat in
  detail the various operations which are considered as being of more
  or less importance in their management. These are potting, watering,
  and temperatures, after which propagation by means of seeds,
  cuttings, and grafting, hybridisation, seed saving, &amp;c., and
  diseases and noxious insects will be treated upon.</p>

  <p><b>Soil.</b>&mdash;The conditions in which plants grow naturally,
  are what we usually try to imitate for their cultivation
  artificially. At all events, such is supposed to be theoretically
  right, however difficult we may often find it to be in practice. Soil
  in some form or other is necessary to the healthy existence of all
  plants; and we know that the nature of the soil varies with that of
  the plants growing in it, or, in other words, certain soils are
  necessary to certain plants, whether in a state of nature or
  cultivated in gardens. But, whilst admitting that Nature, when
  intelligently followed, would not lead us far astray, we must be
  careful not to follow her too strictly when dealing with the
  management of plants in gardens. There are other circumstances
  besides the nature of the soil by which plants are influenced. Soil
  is only one of the conditions on which plants depend, and where the
  other conditions are not exactly the same in our gardens as in
  nature, it is often found necessary to employ a different soil from
  that in which the plants grow when wild.</p>

  <p>It has been stated that plants do not grow naturally in the soil
  best suited for them, and that the reason why many plants are found
  in peculiar places is not at all because they prefer them, but
  because they alone are capable of existing there, or because they
  take refuge there from the inroads of stouter neighbours who would
  destroy them or crowd them out. There are, as every gardener knows,
  numerous plants that succeed equally well in widely different soils,
  and a soil which may be suitable for a plant in one place, may prove
  totally unsuited in another. Hence it is why we find one gardener
  recommending one kind of soil, and another a different one, for the
  same plant, both answering equally well because of other conditions
  fitting better with each soil. This helps us to understand how it is
  that many garden subjects grow much better when planted in composts
  often quite different from those the plants are found in when wild.
  Few plants have a particular predilection for soil, and some have
  what we may call the power to adapt themselves to conditions often
  widely different.</p>

  <p>In Cactuses we have a family of plants for which special
  conditions are necessary; and, as regards soil, whether we are guided
  by nature or by gardening experience, we are led to conclude that
  almost all of them thrive only when planted in one kind, that soil
  being principally loam. Plants which are limited in nature to sandy,
  sun-scorched plains or the glaring sides of rocky hills and
  mountains, where scarcely any other form of vegetation can exist, are
  not likely to require much decayed vegetable humus, but must obtain
  their food from inorganic substances, such as loam, sand, or lime. So
  it is with them when grown in our houses. They are healthiest and
  longest-lived when planted in a loamy soil; and although they may be
  grown fairly well for a time when placed in a compost of loam and
  leaf mould, or loam and peat, yet the growth they make is generally
  too sappy and weak; it is simply fat without bone, which, when the
  necessary resting period comes round, either rots or gradually dries
  up. In preparing soil, therefore, for all Cactuses (except Epiphyllum
  and Rhipsalis, which will be treated separately) a good, rather stiff
  loam, with plenty of grass fibre in it, should form the principal
  ingredient, sand and, if obtainable, small brick rubble being
  added&mdash;one part of each of the latter to six parts of the
  former. The brick rubble should be pounded up so that the largest
  pieces are about the size of hazel nuts. Lime rubbish, <i>i.e.,</i>
  old plaster from buildings, &amp;c., is sometimes recommended for
  Cactuses, but it does not appear to be of any use except as drainage.
  At Kew its use has been discontinued, and it is now generally
  condemned by all good cultivators. Of course, the idea that lime was
  beneficial to Cactuses sprang from the knowledge that it existed in
  large quantities in the soil in which the plants grew naturally, and
  it is often found in abundance, in the form of oxalate of lime, in
  the old stems of the plants. But in good loam, lime, in the state of
  chalk, is always present, and this, together with the lime contained
  in the brick rubble, is sufficient to supply the plants with as much
  as they require.</p>

  <p>For Epiphyllums and Rhipsalis, both of which are epiphytal
  naturally, but which are found to thrive best in pots in our houses,
  a mixture of equal parts of peat and loam with sand and brick rubble
  in the same proportion as before recommended, will be found most
  suitable. Leaf mould is sometimes used for these plants; but unless
  really good it is best left out of the soil. The finest Epiphyllums
  have been grown in a soil which consists almost wholly of a light
  fibry loam, with the addition of a little crushed bones.</p>

  <p><b>Potting.</b>&mdash;Cactuses, when healthy, are injuriously
  affected by frequent disturbance at the roots. On the arrival of the
  potting season, which for these plants is in April and May,
  established plants should be examined at the root, and if the roots
  are found to be in a healthy condition, and the soil sweet, they
  should be replaced in the same pots to continue in them another year.
  If the roots are decayed, or the soil has become sour, it should be
  shaken away from the roots, which must be examined, cutting away all
  decayed portions, and shortening the longest roots to within a few
  inches of the base of the plant. Cactuses are so tenacious of life,
  and appear to rely so little on their roots, that it will be found
  the wisest plan, when repotting them, to cut the roots
  thoroughly.</p>

  <p>The size of pots most suitable is what would be considered small
  in comparison with other plants, Cactuses preferring to be somewhat
  cramped in this respect. This, indeed, is how they are found when
  wild, the roots generally fixing themselves in the crevices of the
  rocks or stones about which the plants grow, so that a large specimen
  is often found to have only a few inches of space in the cleft of a
  rock for the whole of its roots. When thus limited, growth is firmer
  and the flowers are produced in much greater profusion than when a
  liberal amount of root space is afforded. The pots should be well
  drained-about one-fifth of their depth filled with drainage when
  intended for large, strong-growing kinds, and one-third for the
  smaller ones, such as Mamillarias. A layer of rough fibry material
  should be placed over the crocks to prevent the finer soil from
  stopping the drainage. When filling in the soil, press it down
  firmly, spreading the roots well amongst it, and keeping the base of
  the plant only an inch or so below the surface.</p>

  <p>For plants with weak stems, stakes will be necessary, and even
  stout-stemmed kinds, when their roots are not sufficient to hold them
  firmly, will do best if fastened to one or two strong stakes till
  they have made new roots and got firm hold of the soil. Epiphyllums,
  when grown as standards, should be tied to strong wire supports,
  those with three short, prong-like legs being most desirable, as,
  owing to the weight of the head of the plant, a single stake is not
  sufficient to hold the whole firmly. After potting, no water should
  be given for a few weeks. In fact, if the atmosphere in which the
  plants are placed be kept a little moist, it will not be necessary to
  water them till signs of fresh growth are perceived. For Epiphyllums
  and Rhipsalis, water will be required earlier than this; but even
  they are best left for a few days without water, after they have been
  repotted. As soon as fresh growth is perceived, the plants may be
  well watered, and from this time water may be supplied as often as
  the soil approaches dryness. Newly-imported plants, which on arrival
  are usually much shrivelled and rootless, should be potted in rather
  dry soil and small pots, and treated as recommended above. Cactuses,
  we must remember, contain an abundance of nourishment stored up in
  their stems, and upon this they will continue to exist for a
  considerable time without suffering; and, when their growing season
  comes round, root action commences whether the soil is wet or dry,
  the latter being the most favourable.</p>

  <p>Plants altogether exposed to the air will push roots in due time.
  A remarkable instance of this has been recorded by Mr. J. R. Jackson,
  curator of the museums at Kew. A plant of <i>Pilocereus senilis,</i>
  which had grown too tall for the house, was cut off at the base, and
  placed in the museum as a specimen. Here it gradually dried up to
  within 2 ft. of the top, where a fracture across the stem had been
  made. Above this the stem remained fresh and healthy, and, on
  examining it some months afterwards, it was found that not only had
  the top of the stem remained green, but it had formed roots of its
  own, which had grown down the dead lower portion of the stem, and
  were in a perfectly healthy state. When it is remembered that all
  this happened in the dry atmosphere of a museum, it will be apparent
  how exceptional Cactuses are in their manner of growth, and in the
  wonderful tenacity of life they exhibit under conditions which would
  destroy the majority of plants in a very short time. We sometimes
  find, when examining the bases of Cactus stems, that decay has
  commenced; this is carefully cut out with a sharp knife, and the
  wound exposed to the action of the air till it is perfectly dry, or,
  as we term it, "callused."</p>

  <p><b>Watering.</b>&mdash;It will have peen gathered from what has
  been previously said in relation to the conditions under which the
  majority of the plants of the Cactus family grow when wild, that
  during their season of growth they require a good supply of moisture,
  both at the root and overhead; and afterwards a somewhat lengthened
  period of rest, that is, almost total dryness, accompanied by all the
  sunlight possible, and generally a somewhat high temperature. The
  growing season for all those kinds which require to be kept dry when
  at rest is from the end of April to the middle of August, and during
  this time they should be kept moderately moist, but not constantly
  saturated, which, however, is not likely to occur if the water is not
  carelessly supplied, and the drainage and soil are perfect. This
  treatment corresponds with what happens to Cactuses in a wild state,
  the frequent and heavy rains which occur in the earlier part of the
  summer in the American plains supplying the amount of moisture
  necessary to enable these plants to make fresh growth, and produce
  their beautiful flowers and spine-clothed fruits. After August,
  little or no rain falls, and the Cactuses assume a rather shrivelled
  appearance, which gives them an unhealthy look, but which is really a
  sign of ripeness, promising a plentiful crop of flowers when the
  rainy season again returns.</p>

  <p>As the sun in England is not nearly so powerful as in the hot
  plains of Central America and the Southern States of North America,
  where Cactuses are found in greatest abundance, it will be evident
  that, if flowers are to be produced, we must see that our plants have
  a sufficiency of water in early summer, and little or none during the
  autumn and winter, whilst the whole year round they should be exposed
  to all the sunlight possible, the temperature, of course, varying
  with the requirements of the species, whether it is a native of
  tropical or of temperate regions. It is important that the cultivator
  should understand that if water is liberally supplied all through the
  summer, the plants cannot obtain the rest which is necessary to their
  ripening and producing flowers, as dryness at the root alone is not
  sufficient to provide this, but must be accompanied by exposure to
  bright sunlight, which is not possible in England during winter, so
  that the ripening process must begin before the summer is over.</p>

  <p>It is possible to preserve most Cactuses alive by keeping them
  constantly growing; but, with very few exceptions, such treatment
  prevents the plants from flowering. The following is what is
  practised in the gardens where Cactuses are successfully cultivated.
  For the genera Cereus, Echinopsis, Echinocactus, Mamillaria, Opuntia,
  and Melocactus, a moist tropical house is provided, and in April the
  plants are freely watered at the root, and syringed overhead both
  morning and afternoon on all bright days. This treatment is continued
  till the end of July, when syringing is suspended, and the water
  supplied to the roots gradually reduced. By the end of August, the
  plants are placed in a large light frame with a south aspect, except
  the tall-growing kinds, which are too bulky to remove. In this frame
  the plants are kept till the summer is over, and are watered only
  about once a week should the sun be very powerful. The lights are
  removed on all bright sunny days, but are kept on during wet or dull
  weather, and at night. Under this treatment, many of the species
  assume a reddish appearance, and the thick fleshy-stemmed kinds
  generally shrivel somewhat. There is no occasion for alarm in the
  coloured and shrivelled appearance of the plants: on the contrary, it
  may be hailed as a good sign for flowers.</p>

  <p>A common complaint in relation to Cacti as flowering plants is
  that they grow all right but rarely or never flower. The explanation
  of this is shown by the fact that the plants must be properly ripened
  and rested before they can produce flowers. On the approach of cold
  weather the plants which were removed to a frame to be ripened should
  be brought back into the house for the winter, and kept quite dry at
  the roots till the return of spring, when their flowers will be
  developed either before or soon after the watering season again
  commences.</p>

  <p>Hitherto we have been dealing with those genera which have thick
  fleshy stems; but there still remain the genera Rhipsalis,
  Epiphyllum, and Phyllocactus, which are not capable of bearing the
  long period of drought advised for the former. The last-mentioned
  genus should, however, be kept almost dry at the root during winter,
  and, if placed in a light, airy house till the turn of the year, the
  branches will ripen, and set their flower buds much more readily than
  when they are wintered in a moist, partially-shaded house. During
  summer all the Phyllocactuses delight in plenty of water, and, when
  growing freely, a weak solution of manure affords them good food.
  Epiphyllums must be kept always more or less moist at the root,
  though, of course, when growing freely, they require more water than
  when growth has ceased for the year, which happens late in autumn.
  The same rule applies to Rhipsalis, none of the species of which are
  happy when kept long dry. For the several species of Opuntia and
  Echinopsis, which are sufficiently hardy to be cultivated on a sunny
  rockery out of doors, it will be found a wise precaution to place
  either a pane of glass or a handlight over the plants in wet autumns
  and during winter, not so much to serve as protection from cold as to
  shield them from an excess of moisture at a time when it would prove
  injurious.</p>

  <p><b>Temperature.</b>&mdash;As the amount of heat required by the
  different species of Cactus varies very considerably, and as the
  difference between the summer and winter temperatures for them is
  often as great as it is important, it will be as well if we mention
  the temperature required by each when describing the species. It is
  true that the majority of Cactuses may be kept alive in one house
  where all would be subjected to the same temperature, but many of the
  plants would merely exist, and could not possibly flower. It would be
  easy to point to several instances of this unsatisfactory state of
  things. At Kew, for example, owing to the arrangements necessary for
  the public, it is found convenient to have the majority of the large
  collection of Cactuses in one house, where the plants present an
  imposing appearance, but where, as might be expected, a good number
  of the species very rarely produce flowers. The Cactuses which
  inhabit the plains of the Southern United States are subjected to a
  very high summer temperature, and a winter of intense cold; whilst on
  the other hand the species found in Central and South America do not
  undergo nearly so wide an extreme, the difference between the summer
  and winter temperatures of these countries being generally much less
  marked. A word will be said under each species as to whether it is
  tropical, temperate, or hardy, a tropical temperature for Cacti being
  in summer 70 degs., rising to 90 degs. with sun heat, night
  temperature 60 degs. to 70 degs., in winter 60 degs. to 65 degs.
  Temperate: in summer 60 degs., rising to 75 degs. with sun heat,
  night 60 degs. to 65 degs., in winter 50 degs. to 55 degs. The hardy
  species will, of course, bear the ordinary temperatures of this
  country; but, to enable them to withstand a very cold winter, they
  must be kept as dry as possible. In the colder parts of England it is
  not advisable to leave any of these plants outside during winter.</p>

  <p><b>Insect Pests.</b>&mdash;Notwithstanding the thickness of skin
  characteristic of almost every one of the Cactuses, they are
  frequently attacked by various kinds of garden pests when under
  cultivation, and more especially by mealy bug. There is, of course,
  no difficulty in removing such insects from the species with few or
  no spines upon their stems; but when the plants are thickly covered
  with clusters of spines and hairs, the insects are not easily got rid
  of. For Cactuses, as well as for other plants subject to this most
  troublesome insect, various kinds of insecticide have been
  recommended; but the best, cheapest, and most effectual with which we
  are acquainted is paraffin, its only drawback being the injury it
  does to the plants when applied carelessly, or when not sufficiently
  diluted. A wineglassful of the oil, added to a gallon of soft water,
  and about 2oz. of soft soap, the whole to be kept thoroughly mixed by
  frequently stirring it, forms a solution strong enough to destroy
  mealy bug. In applying this mixture, a syringe should be used, or, if
  the plants are to be dipped overhead, care must be taken to have the
  oil thoroughly diffused through the water, or the plant, when lifted
  out, will be covered with pure paraffin, which does not mix properly
  with water, but swims upon the surface if allowed to stand for a few
  moments. The plants should be laid on their sides to be syringed with
  the mixture, and after they have been thoroughly wetted, they may be
  allowed to stand for a few minutes before being syringed with pure
  water. Plants that are badly infested with mealy bug should be
  syringed with the paraffin mixture once a day, for about a week. It
  is easy to do serious harm to these plants by using a stronger
  solution than is here recommended, and also by not properly mixing
  the oil with the soap and water; and the amateur cannot, therefore,
  be too careful in his use of this excellent insecticide. It would be
  easy to recommend other insecticides, so called, for Cactuses; but
  whilst they are less dangerous to the plants, they are often as
  harmless as pure water to the insects.</p>

  <p>For scale, which sometimes infests these plants, and which is
  sometimes found upon them when wild, the paraffin may be used with
  good effect.</p>

  <p>Thrips attack Phyllocactus, Rhipsalis, and Epiphyllum, especially
  when the plants are grown in less shade, or in a higher temperature,
  than is good for them. Fumigation with tobacco, dipping in a strong
  solution of tobacco, or sponging with a mixture of soap and water,
  are either of them effectual when applied to plants infested with
  thrips. The same may be said of green-fly, which sometimes attacks
  the Epiphyllums.</p>

  <p>A blight, something similar to mealy bug, now and again appears on
  the roots of some of the varieties of Echinocactus and Cereus. This
  may be destroyed by dipping the whole of the roots in the mixture
  recommended for the stems when infested by mealy bug, and afterwards
  allowing them to stand for a few minutes immersed in pure water. They
  may then be placed where they will dry quickly, and finally, in a day
  or two, repotted into new compost, first removing every particle of
  the old soil from the roots.</p>

  <p><b>Diseases.</b>&mdash;When wild and favourably situated as
  regards heat and moisture, the larger kinds of Cactus are said to
  live to a great age, some of the tree kinds, according to Humboldt,
  bearing about them signs of having existed several hundred years. The
  same remarkable longevity, most likely, is found in the smaller kinds
  when wild. Under artificial cultivation there are, however, many
  conditions more or less unfavourable to the health of plants, and, in
  the case of Cactuses, very large specimens, when imported from their
  native haunts to be placed in our glass houses, soon perish. At Kew,
  there have been, at various times, very fine specimens of some of the
  largest-growing ones, but they have never lived longer than a year or
  so, always gradually shrinking in size till, finally, owing to the
  absence of proper nourishment, and to other untoward conditions, they
  have broken down and rotted. This rotting of the tissue, or flesh, of
  these plants is the great enemy to their cultivation in England. When
  it appears, it should be carefully cut out with a sharp knife, and
  exposed to the influence of a perfectly dry atmosphere for a few days
  till the wound has dried, when the plant should be potted in a sandy
  compost and treated as for cuttings. Sometimes the decay begins in
  the side of the stem of the plant, in which case it should be cut
  away, and the wound exposed to a dry air. The cause of this decay at
  the base or in the side of the stems of Cactuses is no doubt
  debility, which is the result of the absence of some necessary
  condition when the plants are cultivated in houses or windows in this
  country.</p>

  <p>Grafted plants, especially Epiphyllums, when worked on to Pereskia
  stocks, are apt to grow weak and flabby through the stem wearing out,
  or through the presence of mealy bug or insects in the crevices of
  the part where the stock and scion join, in which case it is best to
  prepare fresh stocks of Pereskia, and graft on to them the best of
  the pieces of Epiphyllum from the old, debilitated plant. It is no
  use trying to get such plants to recover, as, when once this disease
  or weakness begins, it cannot easily be stopped.</p>

  <p>ACTUSES may be multiplied from cuttings of the stems, from seeds,
  and also by means of grafting; this last method being adopted for
  those species which, under cultivation, are not easily kept in health
  when growing upon their own roots, or, as in the case of Epiphyllums,
  when it offers a means of speedily forming large and shapely
  specimens. From seeds the plants are generally freer in growth than
  when cuttings are used, although the seedlings are longer in growing
  into flowering specimens than large cuttings would be. To the
  amateur, the process of germination and development from the seedling
  to the mature stage, is full of interest and attraction, the changes
  from one form to another as the plant develops being very marked in
  most of the genera.</p>

  <p><b>Seeds.</b>&mdash;Good fresh seeds of Cactaceous plants
  germinate in from two to four weeks after sowing, if placed in a warm
  house or on a hotbed with a temperature of 80 degs. If sown in a
  lower temperature, the time they take to vegetate is longer; but,
  unless in a very low degree of heat, the seeds, if good, and if
  properly managed as regards soil and water, rarely fail to germinate.
  For all the kinds, pots or pans containing drainage to within 2 in.
  of the top, and then filled up with finely sifted loam and sand,
  three parts of the former to one of the latter, and pressed down
  moderately firm, will be found to answer. If the soil be moist at the
  time of sowing the seeds, it will not be necessary to water it for a
  day or two. The seeds should be scattered thinly over the surface of
  the soil, and then covered with about 1/8 in. of soil. Over this, a
  pane of glass may be placed, and should remain till the seedlings
  appear above the soil. Should the position where the seeds are to be
  raised be in a room window, this pane of glass will be found very
  useful in preventing the dry air of the room from absorbing all the
  moisture from the soil about the seeds. For the germination of
  Cactus, and indeed of all seeds, a certain amount of moisture must be
  constantly present in the soil; and after a seed has commenced to
  grow, to allow it to get dry is to run the risk of killing it.</p>

  </div><i>a,</i> One month after germination. <i>b,</i> Two months
  after germination. <i>c,</i> Three months after germination.
  (Magnified six times).

  <p>The seeds of Cactuses may be sown at anytime in the year; but it
  is best to sow in spring, as, after germinating, the young plants
  have the summer before them in which to attain sufficient strength to
  enable them to pass through the winter without suffering; whereas
  plants raised from autumn-sown seeds have often a poor chance of
  surviving through the winter, unless treated with great care. The
  seeds of all Cactuses are small, and therefore the seedlings are at
  first tiny globular masses of watery flesh, very different from what
  we find in the seedlings of ordinary garden plants. The form of the
  seedling of a species of Cereus is shown at Fig. 4, and its
  transition from a small globule-like mass of flesh to the
  spine-clothed stem, which characterises this genus, is also
  represented. At <i>a</i> we see the young plant after it has emerged
  from the seed, the outer shell of which was attached to one of the
  sides of the aperture at the top till about a week before the drawing
  was made. At <i>b,</i> the further swelling and opening out, as it
  were, of what, in botanical language, is known as the cotyledon stage
  of development, will be seen; a month afterwards, this will have
  assumed the shape of a very small Cereus. It is interesting to note
  how the soft fleshy mass which first grows out of the seed is nothing
  more than a little bag of food with a tiny growing point fixed in its
  top, and that, as the growing point increases, the food bag
  decreases, till finally the whole of the latter becomes absorbed into
  the young stem, which is now capable of obtaining nourishment by
  means of its newly-formed roots.</p>

    "seedlings of opuntia, showing mode of germination" />

    <p>FIG. 5.&mdash;SEEDLINGS OF OPUNTIA, SHOWING MODE OF
    GERMINATION.</p>
  </div>

  <p>In the genus Opuntia, the cotyledon stage (see Fig. 5) of the
  plant is different from that of the Cereus, and is more like that of
  a cucumber. Still, though the form is different, the purpose of the
  two cotyledons and the juicy stem in the seedling Opuntia is the same
  as in the Cereus; and, as the growing point develops, the cotyledons
  shrivel up and fall off, the plant food they contained having passed
  into that part of the young seedling which was to be permanent. The
  seedlings of these two genera serve as an illustration of the process
  of germination from seed of all the Cactuses; and it must be evident
  that there is much that is singular and full of interest in raising
  these plants from seeds. As soon as the seedlings are large enough to
  be handled, they may be planted separately in small pots, using a
  compost similar to, but slightly coarser than, that in which the
  seeds were sown. The soil should be kept moist till the summer is
  over; and after that, till the return of warm sunny weather, it will
  be found safest to keep the seedlings on the dry side, a little water
  only to be given at intervals of a week, and only when the sun is
  shining upon the plants.</p>

  <p>To obtain seeds from cultivated plants, it is necessary, in order
  to insure fertilisation that the top of the stigma (see Fig. 2)
  should be dusted over with the dust-like pollen from the anthers.
  This may be done by means of a small camel-hair brush, which should
  be moistened in the mouth and then pushed among the anthers till
  covered with pollen, which may then be gently rubbed on to the
  stigma. A warm, sunny morning is the most suitable time for this
  operation, as fertilisation takes place much more readily under the
  influence of bright sunshine than at any other time. Some of the
  kinds have their floral organs so arranged as to be capable of
  self-fertilisation; still, it is always as well to give them some
  assistance. The night-flowering species must, of course, be
  fertilised either at night or very early in the morning. By using the
  pollen from one kind for dusting on to the stigma of another, hybrids
  may be obtained, and it is owing to the readiness with which the
  plants of this family cross with each other, that so many hybrids and
  forms of the genera Epiphyllum and Phyllocactus have been raised. It
  would be useless to attempt such a cross as Epiphyllum with <i>Cereus
  giganteus,</i> because of their widely different natures; but such
  crosses as Epiphyllum with Phyllocactus, and <i>Cereus
  flagelliformis</i> with <i>C. speciosissimus,</i> have been brought
  about. To an enthusiast, the whole order offers a very good field for
  operations with a view to the production of new sorts, as the
  different kinds cross freely with each other, and the beautiful
  colours of the flowers would most likely combine so as to present
  some new and distinct varieties.</p>

  <p><b>Cuttings.</b>&mdash;No plants are more readily increased from
  stem-cuttings than Cactuses; for, be the cutting 20 ft. high, or only
  as large as a thimble, it strikes root readily if placed in a warm
  temperature and kept slightly moist. We have already seen how, even
  in the dry atmosphere of a museum, a stem of Cereus, instead of
  perishing, emitted roots and remained healthy for a considerable
  time, and it would be easy to add to this numerous other instances of
  the remarkable tenacity of life possessed by these plants. At Kew, it
  is the common practice, when the large-growing specimens get too tall
  for the house in which they are grown, to cut off the top of the stem
  to a length of 6 ft. or 8 ft., and plant it in a pot of soil to form
  a new plant. The old base is kept for stock, as it often happens that
  just below the point where the stem was severed, lateral buds are
  developed, and these, when grown into branches, are removed and used
  as cuttings. Large Opuntias are treated in the same way, with the
  almost invariable result that even the largest branches root freely,
  and are in no way injured by what appears to be exceedingly rough
  treatment. Large cuttings striking root so freely, it must follow
  that small cuttings will likewise soon form roots, and, so far as our
  experience&mdash;which consists of some years with a very large
  collection of Cactuses&mdash;goes, there is not one species in
  cultivation which may not be easily multiplied by means of cuttings.
  The nature of a Cactus stem is so very different from the stems of
  most other plants, that no comparison can be made between them in
  respect of their root-developing power; the rooting of a Cactus
  cutting being as certain as the rooting of a bulb. The very soft,
  fleshy stems of some of the kinds such as the Echinocactus, should be
  exposed to the air for a time, so that the cut at the base may dry
  before it is buried in the soil. If the base of a plant decays, all
  that is necessary is the removal of the decayed portion, exposure of
  the wound to the air for two or three days, and then the planting of
  the cutting in a dry, sandy soil, and placing it in a warm moist
  house till rooted. All cuttings of Cactuses may be treated in this
  way. If anything proves destructive to these cuttings, it is
  excessive moisture in the soil, which must always be carefully
  guarded against.</p>

  <p><b>Grafting.</b>&mdash;The object of grafting is generally either
  to effect certain changes in the nature of the scion, by uniting it
  with a stock of a character different from its own, which usually
  results in the better production of flowers, fruit, &amp;c., or to
  multiply those plants which are not readily increased by the more
  ordinary methods of cuttings or seeds. In the case of Cactuses,
  however, we resort to grafting, not because of any difficulty in
  obtaining the kinds thus treated from either cuttings or seeds, as we
  have already seen that all the species of Cactuses grow freely from
  seed, or are easily raised from cuttings of their stems, nor yet to
  effect any change in the characters of the plants thus treated, but
  because some of the more delicate kinds, and especially the smaller
  ones, are apt to rot at the base during the damp, foggy weather of
  our winters; and, to prevent this, it is found a good and safe plan
  to graft them on to stocks formed of more robust kinds, or even on to
  plants of other genera, such as Cereus or Echinocactus. By this
  means, the delicate plants are raised above the soil whence the
  injury in winter usually arises, and they are also kept well supplied
  with food by the more robust and active nature of the roots of the
  plant upon which they are grafted. Grafting is also adopted for some
  of the Cactuses to add to the grotesqueness of their appearance; a
  spherical Echinocactus or Mamillaria being united to the columnar
  stem of another kind, so as to produce the appearance of a drum
  stick; or a large round-growing species grafted on to three such
  stems, which may then be likened to a globe supported upon three
  columns. As the species and genera unite freely with each other, it
  is possible to produce, by means of grafting, some very
  extraordinary-looking plants, and to a lover of the incongruous and
  "queer," these plants will afford much interest and amusement.
  Besides the above, we graft Epiphyllums, and the long drooping
  Cereuses, such as <i>C. flagelliformis</i>, because of their pendent
  habit, and which, therefore, are seen to better advantage when
  growing from the tall erect stem of some stouter kind, than if
  allowed to grow on their own roots. By growing a Pereskia on into a
  large plant, and then cutting it into any shape desired, we may, by
  grafting upon its spurs or branches a number of pieces of Epiphyllum,
  obtain large flowering specimens of various shapes in a comparatively
  short time. For general purposes, it is usual to graft Epiphyllums on
  to stems, about 1 ft. high, of <i>Pereskia aculeata;</i> pretty
  little standard plants being in this way formed in about a year from
  the time of grafting, As an instance of how easily some kinds may be
  grafted, we may note what was done with a large head of the
  Rat's-tail Cactus which had been grown for some years on the stem of
  <i>Cereus rostratus,</i> but which last year rotted off just below
  the point of union. On re-grafting this head on to the Cereus a
  little lower down, it failed to unite, and, attributing the failure
  to possible ill-health in the stock, we determined to transfer the
  Rat's-tail Cactus to a large stem of <i>Pereskia aculeata,</i> the
  result being a quick union and rapid, healthy growth since. Upon the
  same stock some grafts of Epiphyllum had previously been worked, so
  that it is probable these two aliens will form on their nurse-stem,
  the Pereskia, an attractive combination. In Fig. 6 we have a fine
  example of this kind of grafting. It represents a stem of <i>Pereskia
  Bleo</i> upon which the Rat's-tail Cactus and an Epiphyllum have been
  grafted.</p>

    FLAGELLIFORMIS GRAFTED UPON IT</p>
  </div>

  <p>For most plants the operation of grafting must be carefully and
  skilfully performed, but in the case of Cactuses very little skill is
  necessary if one or two rules, which apply to all kinds of grafting,
  are observed. The period of vigorous growth, and while the sap of
  both the stock and the scion is in motion, is the most favourable
  time for the operation. It is then only necessary, in order to bring
  about a speedy union, that the parts grafted should be cut so as to
  fit each other properly, and then bound or in some way fastened
  together so that they will remain in close contact with each other
  till a union is effected. A close atmosphere and, if possible, a
  little shade should be afforded the worked plants till the grafts
  have taken. The ligature used should not be bound round the graft too
  tightly, or it will prevent the flow of the sap; if bound tightly
  enough to hold the parts together and to prevent their slipping, that
  will be found quite sufficient.</p>

  <p>Epiphyllums are treated as follows: Cuttings of Pereskia are
  rooted and grown on to the required size, and in the month of
  September they are headed down, the tops being used as cuttings.
  Grafts of Epiphyllum are then prepared by cutting them to the
  required length, usually about 6 in., and removing a thin slice of
  the fleshy stem on each side so as to form a flat wedge. The stem of
  Pereskia is then split down about 1 in. with a sharp knife, and into
  this the wedge of the graft is inserted, and fastened either by means
  of a small pin passed through the stem and graft about half-way up
  the slit, or by binding round them a little worsted or matting, the
  former being preferred. The worked plants are then placed in a close
  handlight or propagating frame, having a temperature of about 75
  degs., where they are kept moist by sprinkling them daily with water;
  they must be shaded from bright sunlight. As soon as a union has been
  effected, which will be seen by the grafts beginning to grow, the
  ligature and pin should be removed, and the plants gradually hardened
  off by admitting air to the box, till finally they may be removed to
  the house where it is intended to grow them. In a cottage window this
  operation may be successfully performed if a box with a movable glass
  top, or a large bell glass, be used to keep the grafts close till
  they have taken.</p>

  <p>For the spherical-stemmed kinds of Mamillaria, Cereus,
  Echinocactus, &amp;c., a different method is found to answer. Instead
  of cutting the base of the graft to a wedge shape, it is simply cut
  across the base horizontally, or, in other words, a portion of the
  bottom of the graft is sliced off, and a stock procured which, when
  cut across the top, will about fit the wound at the base of the
  scion; the two sliced parts are placed together, and secured either
  by passing a piece of matting a few times over the top of the graft
  and under the pot containing the stock, or by placing three stakes
  around it in such a way that, when tied together at the top, they
  will hold the graft firmly in position. Another method is that of
  cutting the base of the scion in the form of a round wedge, and then
  scooping a hole out in the centre of the stock large enough to fit
  this wedge; the scion is pressed into this, and then secured in the
  manner above mentioned. To graft one spherical-stemmed kind on to
  three columnar-stemmed ones, the latter must first be established in
  one pot and, when ready for grafting, cut at the top into rounded
  wedges, three holes to correspond being cut into the scion. When
  fixed, the top should be securely fastened by tying it to the pot, or
  by means of stakes. For this last operation, a little patience and
  care are necessary to make the stocks and scions fit properly; but if
  the rules that apply to grafting are properly followed, there will be
  little fear of the operation failing. In the accompanying

  <h3>THE GENUS EPIPHYLLUM.</h3>

  <p>T is now about a century since some of the most beautiful of
  Cactaceous plants came into cultivation in this country, and amongst
  them was the plant now known as <i>E. truncatum,</i> but then called
  <i>Cactus Epiphyllum;</i> the name Cactus being used in a generic
  sense, and not, as now, merely as a general term for the Natural
  Order. Introduced so early, and at once finding great favour as a
  curious and beautiful flowering plant, <i>E. truncatum</i> has been,
  and is still, extensively cultivated, and numerous varieties of it
  have, as a consequence, originated in English gardens. We do not use
  the seeds of these plants for their propagation, unless new varieties
  are desired, when we must begin by fertilising the flowers, and thus
  obtain seeds, which should be sown and grown on till the plants
  flower.</p>

  <p>Epiphyllums have already "broken" from their original or wild
  characters, and are, therefore, likely to yield distinct varieties
  from the first sowing. In the forests which clothe the slopes of the
  Organ Mountains, in Brazil, the Epiphyllums are found in great
  abundance, growing upon the trunks and branches of large trees, and
  occasionally on the ground or upon rocks, up to an elevation of 6000
  ft. It was here that Gardner, when travelling in South America, found
  <i>E. truncatum</i> growing in great luxuriance, and along with it
  the species known as <i>E. Russellianum,</i> which he sent to the
  Duke of Bedford's garden, at Woburn, in 1839. These two species are
  the only ones now recognised by botanists, all the other cultivated
  kinds being either varieties of, or crosses raised from, them.</p>The
  character by which Epiphyllums are distinguished from other Cactuses,
  is their flattened, long, slender branches, which are formed of
  succulent, green, leaf-like branchlets, growing out of the ends of
  each other, to a length of from 3 ft. to 4 ft. As in the majority of
  Cactuses, the stems of Epiphyllum become woody and almost cylindrical
  with age, the axes of the branchlets swell out, and the edges either
  disappear or remain attached, like a pair of wings.

  <p><b>Cultivation.&mdash;</b>Epiphyllums require the temperature of
  an intermediate house in winter, whilst, in summer, any position
  where they can be kept a little close and moist, and be shaded from
  bright sunshine, will suit them. Remembering that their habit, when
  wild, is to grow upon the trunks of trees, where they would be
  afforded considerable shade by the overhanging branches, we cannot be
  wrong in shading them from direct sunshine during summer. Some
  growers recommend placing these plants in a hot, dry house; but we
  have never seen good specimens cultivated under such conditions. All
  through the summer months, the plants should be syringed both morning
  and evening; but by the end of August they will have completed their
  growth, and should, therefore, be gradually exposed to sunshine and
  air.</p>

  <p>It is advisable to discontinue the use of the syringe from
  September till the return of spring, but the plants should always be
  kept supplied with a little moisture at the root and in the air about
  them during the winter months. In this respect, these plants and the
  Rhipsalis are exceptions among Cactuses, as all the others are safest
  when kept dry during the cold, dull weather between September and
  April. The soil most suitable for them is a mixture of peat, loam,
  and sand, unless a light and fibrous loam be obtainable, which is,
  perhaps, the best of all soils for these plants, requiring only the
  addition of a little rotted manure or leaf-mould, silver sand, and
  some small brick rubble. The Pereskia stock is not a stout-rooted
  plant, and does not, therefore, require much root-room, although, by
  putting in plenty of broken crocks as drainage, the soil space in the
  pots may be reduced to what is considered sufficient for the plant.
  If small pots are used, the head of the plant is apt to overbalance
  the whole. The stems should be secured to stout stakes, and, if
  large, umbrella-like specimens are wanted, a frame should be made in
  the form of an umbrella, and the stem and branches fastened to it.
  Smaller plants may be kept in position by means of a single upright
  stake, which should be long enough to stand an inch or two above the
  head of the plant, so that the stoutest branches may be supported by
  attaching a piece of matting to them, and fastening it to the top of
  the stake. In the remarks upon grafting we mentioned the large
  pyramidal specimens of Epiphyllum which are grown by some cultivators
  for exhibition purposes; and, although these plants are much rarer at
  exhibitions now than they were a few years ago, yet they do sometimes
  appear, especially in the northern towns, such as Liverpool and
  Manchester.</p>

  <p>It would not be easy to find a more beautiful object during winter
  than an Epiphyllum, 5 ft. or 6 ft. high, and nearly the same in width
  at the base, forming a dense pyramid of drooping, strap-like branches
  bearing several hundreds of their bright and delicate coloured
  blossoms all at one time, and lasting in beauty for several weeks.
  With a little skill and patience, plants of this size may be grown by
  any amateur who possesses a warm greenhouse; and, although it is not
  easy to manage such large plants in a room window, handsome little
  specimens of the same form may be grown if the window is favourably
  situated and the room kept warm in winter. Mr. J. Wallis, gardener to
  G.Tomline, Esq., of Ipswich, has become famous for the size and
  health of the specimens he has produced. Writing on the cultivation
  of Epiphyllums, Mr. Wallis gives the following details, which are
  especially valuable as coming from one of the most successful
  cultivators of these beautiful plants:</p>

  <p>"The Epiphyllums here are grown for flowering in the conservatory,
  and are usually gay from the first week in November till February.
  During the remainder of the year, they occupy a three-quarter
  span-roof house, in which an intermediate temperature is maintained.
  All our Epiphyllums are grafted on the <i>Pereskia aculeata.</i> We
  graft a few at intervals of two or three years, so, if any of the
  older plants become sickly or shabby, they are thrown away, and the
  younger ones grown on. Some of the stocks are worked to form
  pyramids, and some to form standards. The height of the pyramids is 6
  ft., and, to form these, six or eight scions are inserted. The heads
  of the standards are on stems ranging in height from 4&frac12; ft.
  down to 1&frac12; ft. To form these heads, only one scion is put on
  the stock. Some of our oldest pyramids are 4 ft. or 5 ft. through at
  the base, and the heads of the standards quite as much. When in
  flower, the heads of the latter droop almost to the pots. The
  pyramids occupy No.2 and No.4 sized pots, the standards 8's and 12's.
  Each plant is secured to a strong iron stake, with three prongs
  fitting the inside of the pot, and the Epiphyllum is kept well
  supported to the stake by ties of stout wire. After the plants are
  well established, they are easily managed, and go many years without
  repotting; but, of course, we top-dress them annually, previously
  removing as much of the old soil as will come away easily. We grow
  these plants with plenty of ventilation on all favourable occasions,
  and they are seldom shaded. During active growth, water is given
  freely, occasionally liquid manure; they are also syringed daily.
  After the season's growth is completed, water is given more
  sparingly, and syringing is dispensed with."</p>

  <p>When grown on their own roots, Epiphyllums are useful for planting
  in wire baskets intended to hang near the glass; large and very
  handsome specimens form in a few years, if young rooted plants are
  placed rather thickly round the sides of the baskets, and grown in a
  warm house. Epiphyllums are employed with good effect for covering
  walls, which are first covered with peaty soil by means of wire
  netting, and then cuttings of the Epiphyllums are stuck in at
  intervals of about 1 ft. The effect of a wall of the drooping
  branches of these plants is attractive even when without their
  beautiful flowers; but when seen in winter, clothed with hundreds of
  sparkling blossoms, they present a most beautiful picture. Large
  plants of Pereskia may be trained over pillars in conservatories and
  afterwards grafted with Epiphyllums; in fact, there are many ways in
  which these plants may be effectively employed in gardens.</p>

  <h3>SPECIES.</h3>

  <p><b><a name="etrunc" id="etrunc">E. truncatum</a></b> (jagged);
  Bot. Mag. 2562.&mdash;Branchlets from 1 in. to 3 in. long, and 1 in.
  wide, with two or three distinct teeth along the edges, and a toothed
  or jagged apex (hence the specific name). The flowers are 3 in. long,
  curved above and below, not unlike the letter S; the petals and
  sepals reflexed, and exposing the numerous yellow anthers, through
  which the club-headed stigma protrudes; colour, a deep rose-red, the
  base of the petals slightly paler. The varieties differ in having
  colours which vary from almost pure white, with purplish tips, to a
  uniform rich purple, whilst such colours as salmon, rose, orange, and
  scarlet, are conspicuous among them.</p>

  </div>

  <p><b><a name="eruss" id="eruss">E. Russellianum</a></b> (Russell's);
  Fig. 9.&mdash;This has smaller branchlets than the type plant <i>(E.
  truncatum),</i> and is thus easily distinguished; they do not exceed
  1 in. in length and &frac12; in. in width, whilst the edges are
  irregularly and faintly notched, not distinctly toothed, as in <i>E.
  truncatum.</i> The flowers are a little larger than in the older
  kind, and are not curved, whilst the petals are narrower; their
  colour is bright rosy-red. This species flowers rather later in the
  year than <i>E. truncatum,</i> and may be had in blossom so late as
  the month of May or June. There are several varieties of it which
  have either larger and darker, or smaller and variously tinted
  flowers. Both the species will cross with each other, and probably
  many of the varieties enumerated by nurserymen have been obtained in
  this way.</p>

  <h3>VARIETIES.</h3>

  <p>The following is a selection of the best varieties, with a short
  description of the flowers of each:</p>

  <p><b>E. bicolor</b> (two-coloured).&mdash;Tube of flower white;
  petals purple, becoming almost white towards the base.</p>

  <p><b>E. Bridgesii</b> (Bridges').&mdash;Tube violet; petals dark
  purple.</p>

  <p><b>E. coccineum</b> (scarlet).&mdash;Bright scarlet, paler at the
  base of the petals.</p>

  <p><b>E. cruentum</b> (bloody).&mdash;Tube purplish-scarlet; petals
  bright scarlet.</p>

  <p><b>E. Gaertneri</b> (Gaertner's).&mdash;This is an interesting and
  beautiful hybrid, raised from Epiphyllum and a Cereus of some kind.
  The branchlets are exactly the same as those of <i>E. truncatum,</i>
  but the flowers are not like Epiphyllum at all, resembling rather
  those of Cereus or Phyllocactus. They are brilliant scarlet in
  colour, shaded with violet.</p>

  <p><b>E. magnificum</b> (magnificent).&mdash;Tube rosy-violet; petals
  dark red.</p>

  <p><b>E. salmoneum</b> (salmon-coloured).&mdash;Tube and base of
  petals white, rest salmon-red, shaded with purple.</p>

  <p><b>E. spectabile</b> (remarkable).&mdash;Tube and base of petals
  white; tips of petals carmine.</p>

  <p><b>E. tricolor</b> (three-coloured).&mdash;Tube salmon-red; petals

  <h3>THE GENUS PHYLLOCACTUS.</h3>

  <h4>(From <i>phyllon,</i> a leaf, and <i>Cactus</i>).</h4>

  <div class="figleft">
    <img src="images/fancy_A.gif" width="54" height="113" alt="A" />
  </div><br />

  <p>S in the case of the Epiphyllums, the principal character by which
  the Phyllocactus is distinguished is well described by the name, the
  difference between it and Epiphyllum being that in the former the
  flowers are produced along the margins of the flattened branches,
  whereas in the latter they are borne on the apices of the short,
  truncate divisions. If we compare any of the Phyllocactuses with
  <i>Cereus triangularis,</i> or with C. <i>speciosissimus,</i> we
  shall find that the flowers are precisely similar both in form and
  colour, and sometimes also in size.</p>

  <p>In all the kinds the stem is compressed laterally, so as to look
  as if it had been hammered out flat; or sometimes it is three-angled,
  and the margins are deeply notched or serrated. These notches are
  really the divisions between one leaf and another, for the flat,
  fleshy portions or wings of the stems of these plants are simply
  modified leaves&mdash;not properly separated from each other and from
  the stem, but still to all intents and purposes leaves&mdash;which,
  as the plant increases and matures, gradually wither away, leaving
  the central or woody portion to assume the cylindrical stem which we
  find in all old Phyllocactuses. It is from these notches that the
  large, showy flowers are developed, just as in plants the flowers of
  which are borne from the axils of the leaves.</p>

  <p>Under the names "Spleenwort-leaved Indian Figs," and "Winged
  Torch-thistles," as well as those here adopted, the most beautiful
  perhaps of all Cactuses, and certainly the most useful in a garden
  sense, have been cultivated in English gardens for more than 150
  years; for it was in 1710 that the flowering of <i>E. Phyllanthus</i>
  was first recorded in English horticulture. Philip Miller grew it
  with many other Cactuses in the botanical garden at Chelsea which was
  founded by Sir Hans Sloane, in 1673, to be maintained "for the
  manifestation of the power, wisdom, and glory of God in the works of
  creation," and which still exists as the botanical emporium of the
  Apothecaries' Society. The majority of the gorgeous Phyllocactuses
  which we now possess are of only recent introduction, or are the
  result of cultivation and crossing.</p>

  <p>The species are natives of various parts of tropical America,
  chiefly Mexico and Central America, where they are found generally
  growing, in company with Bromeliads and Orchids, upon the trunks of
  gigantic forest-trees. Phyllocactuses are therefore epiphytes when in
  a wild state, but under cultivation with us, they thrive best when
  planted in pots or in baskets&mdash;the latter method being adapted
  for one or two smaller kinds. It is easy to imagine the gorgeousness
  of a group of these plants when seen enveloping a large tree-trunk,
  clothing it, as it were, with balls of brilliant or pure white
  flowers. We are told by travellers of the splendours of a Cactus
  haunt during the flowering season, and those who have seen a
  well-managed pot specimen of Phyllocactus when covered with large,
  dazzling flowers, can form some idea of what wild plants are like
  when seen by hundreds together, and surrounded by the green foliage
  and festooning climbers which associate with them in the forests
  where they abound.</p>

  <p><b>Cultivation.</b>&mdash;For the following cultural notes we are
  indebted to a most successful grower of Cactuses in Germany, whose
  collection of Phyllocactuses is exceptionally rich and well managed:
  The growing season for these plants is from about the end of April,
  or after the flowers are over, till the end of August. As soon as
  growth commences, the plants should be repotted. A light, rich soil
  should be used, a mixture of loam, peat, and leaf-mould, or rotten
  manure with a little sand, being suitable. Small plants should have a
  fair shift; larger ones only into a size of pot which just admits of
  a thin layer of fresh soil. When pot-bound, the plants flower most
  freely, and it is not necessary to repot large specimens more often
  than about once every three years. When potted they should be placed
  in a sunny position in a close house or frame, and be kept freely
  watered. In bright weather they may be syringed overhead twice a day.
  For the first few days after repotting it is advisable to shade the
  plants from bright sunshine. A stove temperature is required until
  growth is finished. After this they should be gradually ripened by
  admitting more air and exposing to all the sunlight possible. During
  winter very little water is needed, just sufficient to prevent
  shrivelling being safest. Excess of moisture in winter is ruinous, as
  it often kills the roots, and sometimes causes the plant to rot off
  at the collar. The lowest temperature in winter should be 50 degs.,
  lower than this being unsafe, whilst in mild weather it might be 5
  degs. higher.</p>

  <p>It is a bad plan to turn these plants round, in order, as some
  think, to ripen the growths properly. As a matter of fact, it does no
  good, but often does harm, by suddenly exposing the tender parts to
  the full force of sunlight.</p>

  <p>The stems may be trained either in the form of a fan or as a bush.
  Old branches which have flowered and are shrivelling may be cut away
  in the spring.</p>

  <p>Some fine specimens have been grown in pockets on old walls inside
  lean-to greenhouses, where the conditions have been favourable to the
  healthy growth and flowering of most of the species. When grown in
  this way, water must be supplied exactly as advised for plants grown
  in pots; if the pockets are not within easy reach of the watering
  pot, the plants can be watered by means of a heavy syringing.</p>

  <p><b>Propagation.</b>&mdash;For the propagation of the Phyllocactus
  either the whole plant may be divided at the base, or cuttings of the
  branches may be used; the latter, after having dried by remaining
  with their bases exposed to the air for a day or two, should be
  planted in small pots filled with very sandy soil; they may be placed
  on a dry, sunny shelf near the glass, and be slightly sprinkled
  overhead daily till rooted. Seeds, which sometimes ripen on
  cultivated plants, should be gathered as soon as the fleshy fruits
  have turned to a purplish colour, dried for a day or so, then sown in
  a light, porous soil, and placed in a warm frame or house to
  germinate.</p>

  <h3>SPECIES.</h3>

  <p><b><a name="paker" id="paker">P. Akermanni</a></b> (named after a
  Mr. Akermann, who introduced it from Mexico in 1829); Fig.
  10.&mdash;Stem becoming cylindrical at an early age, and clothed with
  little clusters of spiny hairs; the branches are flattened out, and
  form broad, rather thin, blade-like growths, with the margins
  sinuately lobed (waved and notched). The flowers are large&mdash;over
  6 in. in diameter&mdash;the petals, very acutely pointed and
  undulated along the edges; flower tube 2 in. long, with a few small
  scales scattered over its surface; stamens curved, clustered around
  the stigma, and almost hiding it. Colour of whole flower a rich
  scarlet, with a satin-like lustre. Flowers in June and July.</p>

  </div>

  <p>This is one of the best-known kinds, having been extensively
  cultivated as an ornamental greenhouse plant till within the last few
  years. It was grown by several nurserymen for Covent Garden Market
  about eight years ago; small plants, about 1 ft. high, and bearing
  each from two to six flowers, finding much favour among the
  costermongers, as the plants could be bought at a low price, and,
  owing to their large, brilliant flowers, always sold well at a good
  profit. This species has been employed by the hybridists for the
  obtaining of new kinds, and some very handsome and distinct varieties
  have consequently been raised. As well as crossing with other species
  of Phyllocactus, <i>P. Akermanni</i> has been used in combination
  with several species of Cereus, good hybrids having been the result.
  As a compact-growing and free-flowering species, this may be
  specially recommended.</p>

  <p><b><a name="pangu" id="pangu">P. anguliger</a></b>
  (angle-stemmed); Fig. 11.&mdash;The branches of this kind are
  distinguished by having the notches along their margins more like the
  teeth of a saw than the others. The habit is rather stiff and erect.
  The flowers are produced near the apex of the branches, and are
  composed of a curved tube 6 in. long, spreading out at the top to a
  width of 6 in., and surmounted by a whorl of pure white petals, in
  the centre of which are the stamens, rather few in number, and the
  large, ten-rayed stigma. The flowers are developed in December and
  January, and have a powerful and delicious odour. Introduced, in
  1837, from West Mexico, where it is said to grow in oak forests.</p>

  intermediate between this genus and the Epiphyllums. It possesses no
  particular beauty or distinctive character such as would render it of
  much value for garden purposes. The branches are short, rather narrow
  and drooping, the margins notched and tinged with red. The flowers
  are borne generally on the ends of the branches, and are drooping in
  habit; in form they are more like the Epiphyllums than the ordinary
  Phyllocactuses, as they have their petals arranged in a sort of tube
  about 3 in. long. The fruit is a red berry as large as a gooseberry.

  <p><b><a name="pcren" id="pcren">P. crenatus</a></b> (toothed); Bot.
  Reg. 3031.&mdash;A large-flowered and very beautiful species,
  rivalling, in the size and fragrance of its blossoms, the gigantic
  night-flowering <i>Cereus grandiflorus.</i> It grows to a height of
  about 2 ft., with round-based branches, the upper portion flattened
  out and the margins serrated. The flower tube is 4 in. long,
  brownish-green, as also are the sepals; petals 4 in. long, in a
  whorl, the points curving inwards; stamens and pistil erect, forming
  along with the petals a large star of a pale cream-colour. The beauty
  and fragrance of these flowers, which open in June, render them
  specially valuable for cutting and placing in rooms, where,
  notwithstanding their short duration, they never fail to win much
  admiration. Introduced from Honduras, in 1839. This fine species is
  one of the parents of the hybrids which have been raised both in this
  country and in America, where Mr. Hovey succeeded in obtaining some
  of the choicest as regards colour and size. Some of these latter were
  exhibited in London two or three years ago, and were much
  admired.</p>

  <p><b><a name="pgran" id="pgran">P. grandis</a></b>
  (large-flowered).&mdash;The large, creamy-white flowers of this plant
  are like those of the night-flowering Cereus; and, in addition to the
  similarity in form and size between these two, there is a further one
  in the time when the flowers expand, this species, along with one or
  two others, opening its flowers after sunset; and although they
  remain in good condition till late on in the day following, and
  sometimes even longer, we may suppose that the proper flowering time
  is at night. The delicious almond scent of the flowers of this fine
  Cactus is so strong, that during the flowering period the atmosphere
  of the large Cactus-house at Kew Gardens is permeated with it, the
  large specimens there having usually a score or more flowers open
  together, the effect of which is truly grand. Even this number of
  flowers is, for this species, by no means extraordinary, specimens
  having been grown elsewhere, in pots only 8 in. across, with as many
  flowers open on each. From this it will be seen that <i>P.
  grandis</i> is one of the most useful kinds, its large, sweet-scented
  flowers, and its free-growing nature, rendering it of exceptional
  value as a decorative plant. Its branches are broad and notched along
  the margins, and the flowers are 1 ft. in length, including the tube,
  whilst across the broad, spreading petals they measure almost as
  much. Honduras. Introduced 1837 (?). Time of flowering, summer and
  autumn.</p>

  <p><b><a name="phook" id="phook">P. Hookeri</a></b> (Hooker's); Bot.
  Mag. 2692, under <i>Cactus Phyllanthus.</i>&mdash;A robust-growing
  kind, often attaining to the size of a good shrub. Its flowers expand
  in the evening, and are sweet-scented. They are produced along the
  margins of the broad, flat, deeply-notched branches, the serratures
  being rounded instead of angled, as in some of the kinds. The tube of
  the flower is long and slender, no thicker than a goose quill, and
  covered with reddish scales; the petals are spreading, and form a cup
  6 in. across; they are narrow, pointed, and pure white, the outer
  whorl, as well as the sepals, being tinged on the under side with a
  tawny colour. The stamens form a large cluster in the centre, and are
  bright yellow, the style being red and yellow. It is probable that
  this plant has been in cultivation for many years, as it was figured
  in the work quoted above under the name of one of the first
  introduced kinds of Phyllocactus, from which, however, it is
  abundantly distinct, as will be seen by a comparison of the
  descriptions of the two. There are, in the Kew collection, several
  large plants of <i>P. Hookeri</i> that flower annually during the
  summer and autumn. Brazil.</p>

  <p><b><a name="plati" id="plati">P. latifrons</a></b>
  (broad-stemmed); Bot. Mag. 3813.&mdash;This is another large-growing
  species, as large at least as <i>P. Hookeri</i>, to which, indeed, it
  bears a close resemblance, both in flowers and in habit. Like that
  species, too, its date of introduction is not known, though it
  appears to have been cultivated in England at an early period. It may
  be grown so as to form a large shrub in a few years; or by cutting it
  back annually, or growing on young plants from cuttings every two
  years, nice little pot plants may be obtained; and as the plant
  produces flowers freely when in a small state, it is available for
  small greenhouses as well as for large ones. A fine specimen, such,
  for instance, as that at Kew, which is over 8 ft. in height, and well
  furnished with branches, is an attractive object when clothed with
  numerous creamy-white flowers, here and there tinged with red. The
  branches are from 4 in. to 5 in. broad, and deeply notched; the
  flowers are about 8 in. in length, and the same across the spreading
  petals. Mexico. Spring.</p>

  <p><b><a name="pphyl" id="pphyl">P. phyllanthus</a></b>
  (leaf-flowering).&mdash;This species is now rarely seen in
  cultivation. As the oldest of the garden kinds it is, however,
  deserving of a little notice. Philip Miller grew it in his collection
  in 1710. The branches are broad and flat, the edges waved, not
  notched, and the flowers are composed of a thin tortuous tube, 9 in.
  in length, bearing at the top a whorl of recurved greenish petals, 1
  in. long, with a cluster of whitish stamens and a green, club-shaped
  style and stigma. Brazil.</p>

  <p><b><a name="ppoid" id="ppoid">P. phyllanthoides</a></b>
  (phyllanthus-like); Bot. Mag. 2092.&mdash;For the introduction of
  this handsome-flowered kind we are indebted to the great travellers
  and naturalists, Humboldt and Bonpland, who discovered it growing in
  the woods upon the trunks of old trees around Cartagena in South
  America. Plants of it were forwarded by them to France, where they
  flowered for the first time in 1811. From that time till now this
  species has been in favour as a garden plant, though it is, at the
  present time, much less common in English gardens than it deserves to
  be. The branches are broad, triangular when young, flat when old,
  about 1 ft. long by 2 in. wide, with shallow incisions, the
  serrations rather sharply angled. The height of the plant is from 2
  ft. to 3 ft. The flowers are produced on the margins of the young
  branches, and are composed of a short, thick tube, not more than 2
  in. in length, and short, dark, recurved scales; the petals are
  broad, pointed, and form a stellate cluster about 4 in. across; they
  are of a bright rose-colour, streaked with white, and shaded here and
  there with a darker colour of red. The stamens are numerous and pure
  white. The flowers open in the day-time, and are scentless; they last
  in perfection for two or three days, and may, therefore, be employed
  as cut flowers for vases, &amp;c. Early summer.</p>

  <h3>HYBRIDS AND VARIETIES.</h3>

  <p>In addition to the cultivated species of Phyllocactus there are
  numerous hybrids and varieties, many of which are beautiful and

  <h3>THE GENUS CEREUS.</h3>

  <h5>(From <i>cereus,</i> pliant; in reference to the stems of some
  species.)</h5>

  <div class="figleft">
    <img src="images/fancy_O.jpg" width="53" height="113" alt="O" />
  </div><br />

  <p>VER 200 distinct species of Cereus are, according to botanists,
  distributed over the tropical and temperate regions of America and
  the West Indies, extending to the Galapagos, or "Tortoise" Islands,
  200 miles off the coast of Peru. It was in these islands that the
  late Charles Darwin found several small kinds of Cereus, some of them
  growing near the snow-line in exposed situations on the highest
  mountains. In Mexico, <i>C. giganteus,</i> the most colossal of all
  Cacti, is found rearing its tall, straight, columnar stems to a
  height of 60 ft., and branching near the top, "like petrified giants
  stretching out their arms in speechless pain, whilst others stand
  like lonely sentinels keeping their dreary watch on the edge of
  precipices." In the West Indies most of the night-flowering kinds are
  common, their long, creeping stems clinging by means of aerial roots
  to rocks, or to the exposed trunks of trees, where their enormous,
  often fragrant, flowers are produced in great abundance, expanding
  only after the sun has set. Between these three distinct groups we
  find among the plants of this elegant genus great variety both in
  size and form of the stem and in the flower characters of the
  different species. A large proportion of the 200 kinds known are not
  cultivated in European gardens, and perhaps for many of them it is
  not possible for us to provide in our houses the peculiar conditions
  they require for their healthy existence. But there are a good many
  species of Cereus represented in gardens, even in this country, and
  among them we shall have no difficulty in finding many useful and
  beautiful kinds, such as may be cultivated with success in an
  ordinary greenhouse or stove. Lemaire, a French writer on Cactuses,
  groups a number of species under the generic name of Echinocereus;
  but as this name is not adopted in England, it is omitted here, all
  the kinds being included under Cereus.</p>

  <h3>THE NIGHT-FLOWERING SPECIES.</h3>The most interesting group is
  that of the climbing night-flowering kinds, on account of their
  singular habit of expanding their flowers in the dark and of the very
  large size and brilliant colours of their flowers. In habit the
  plants of this set are trailers or climbers, their stems are either
  round or angled, and grow to a length of many feet, branching freely
  as they extend. By means of their roots, which are freely formed upon
  the stems, and which have the power of attaching themselves to stones
  or wood in the same way as ivy does, these kinds soon spread over and
  cover a large space; they are, therefore, useful for training over
  the back walls in lean-to houses, or for growing against rafters or
  pillars&mdash;in fact, in any position exposed to bright sunlight and
  where there is a good circulation of air. Soil does not appear to
  play an important part with these plants, as they will grow anywhere
  where there is a little brick rubble, gravel, or cinders for their
  basal roots to nestle in. They have been grown in the greatest
  luxuriance and have produced flowers in abundance with nothing more
  than their roots buried in the crumbling foundations of an old wall,
  upon which the stems were clinging. The chief consideration is
  drainage, as, unless the roots are kept clear of anything like
  stagnation, they soon perish through rot. During the summer, the
  stems should be syringed morning and evening on all bright days,
  whilst in winter little or no water will be required.

  <p>Like all other Cactuses, these plants may be propagated by means
  of large branches, which, if placed in a porous soil, will strike
  root in a few weeks. We saw a very large specimen of <i>C.
  triangularis,</i> which last autumn suddenly rotted at the base, from
  some cause or other, and to save the specimen, a mound was built up
  of brick rubble and soil, high enough to surround the base of the
  plant above the rotted part. In a few weeks there was a good crop of
  new roots formed, and the plant has since flowered most
  satisfactorily. With almost any other plant, this course would have
  proved futile; but Cactuses are singularly tenacious of life, the
  largest and oldest stems being capable of forming roots as freely and
  as quickly as the young ones.</p>

  <p><b><a name="cext" id="cext">C. extensus</a></b> (long-stemmed);
  Bot. Mag. 4066.&mdash;This has long rope-like stems, bluntly
  triangular, less than 1 in. thick, with very short spines, arranged
  in pairs or threes, about 1 in. apart along the angles, and aerial
  roots. The flowers are developed all along the stems, and are
  composed of a thick, green, scale-clothed tube, about 3 in. long; the
  larger scales yellow and green, tipped with red, and a spreading cup
  formed of the long-pointed sepals and petals, the former yellow,
  green, and red, the latter white, tinted with rose. The flower is
  about 9 in. across. When in blossom, this plant equals in beauty the
  finest of the climbing Cactuses, but, unfortunately, it does not
  flower as freely as most of its kind. It is cultivated at Kew, where
  it has flowered once during the last five years. A native of
  Trinidad, whence it was introduced, and first flowered in August,
  1843. Judging by the conditions under which it grows and blossoms in
  its native haunts, no doubt its shy-flowering nature under
  cultivation here is owing to the absence of a long continuance of
  bright sunshine and moisture, followed by one of drought and
  sunlight. If placed in a favourable condition as regards light, and
  carefully treated in respect of water, it ought to flower.</p>

  <p><b><a name="cfulg" id="cfulg">C. fulgidus</a></b> (glittering);
  Bot. Mag. 5856.&mdash;In the brilliant deep scarlet of its large
  buds, and the bright orange-scarlet of the expanded flowers, this
  species stands quite alone among the night-flowering,
  scandent-stemmed Cereuses. Its one drawback is its shy-flowering
  nature, as it is rarely seen in blossom even when liberally treated,
  and along with the other kinds which flower so freely. The history of
  this plant is not known; but it is supposed to be a hybrid between
  <i>C. Pitajayi</i> or <i>variabilis</i> and one of the
  scarlet-flowered Phyllocactuses, or, possibly, <i>C.
  speciosissimus</i>. It first flowered at Kew, in July, 1870. Stems
  bright green, slow-growing, three or four-angled, about 2 in. wide;
  angles much compressed, so that a section of the stem shows a cross;
  margins notched, with clusters of short, hair-like spines at each
  notch. Flowers 6 in. long, and about the same across the top; tube
  covered with soft hairs and short deep-red scales, which are enlarged
  towards the top, where they spread out, and form, along with the
  petals, a large rosette of several whorls, arranged as in a
  semi-double rose, the centre being occupied by a brush-like cluster
  of greenish stamens, with the radiating stigma standing erect in the
  middle. It is to be regretted that the flowers are not more freely
  produced by cultivated plants.</p>

  <p><b><a name="cgrand" id="cgrand">C. grandiflorus</a></b>
  (large-flowered); Bot. Mag. 3381.&mdash;There is scarcely any plant
  that makes a more magnificent appearance when in full blossom than
  this. A strong plant will produce many flowers together, but they do
  not remain long expanded, opening at seven or eight o'clock in the
  evening, and fading at sunrise the next morning; nor do they ever
  open again, even when cut and placed in warm water in a dark place.
  The closing of the flowers may, however, be retarded for a whole day
  by removing the bud before it is fully open and placing it in water.
  The stems are almost cylindrical, with four to seven slight ridges,
  or angles, which bear numerous tufts of wool and short stiff spines.
  Roots are thrown out from all parts of the stem, even when not in
  contact with anything. The flowers are developed on the sides of the
  stems, principally the younger, shorter ones; the flower tube is
  about 4 in. long by 1 in. in diameter, and is covered with short
  brown scales and whitish hairs; the calyx is 1 ft. across, and is
  composed of a large number of narrow sepals of a bright yellow colour
  inside, brown on the outside; the petals are broad, pure white, and
  arranged in a sort of cup inclosing the numerous yellow stamens and
  the club-shaped stigma. The flower has a delicious vanilla-like
  odour, which perfumes the air to a considerable distance. Flowers in
  July. Native of the West Indies. Introduced 1700, at which time it is
  said to have been cultivated in the Royal Gardens at Hampton
  Court.</p>

  <p><b><a name="clema" id="clema">C. Lemairii</a></b> (Lemaire's);
  Bot. Mag. 4814.&mdash;In the size and fragrance of its blossoms, and
  also in the brilliancy of its colours, this species rivals <i>C.
  grandiflorus;</i> differing in the following particulars: the tube is
  covered with large green, crimson-edged scales instead of small brown
  scales and white hairs; the sepals do not spread out in a star-like
  manner, as in <i>C. grandiflorus,</i> and they are tinged with
  crimson; the stem of the plant shows a bluntly triangular section,
  and the angles are marked with a row of distant spines instead of the
  clusters of spines and wool in <i>C. grandiflorus.</i> In all other
  particulars, these two species are almost identical, so that where
  space is limited either the one or the other will be sufficient to
  represent both. <i>C. Lemairii</i> was introduced into England
  through Kew, whither a plant was sent in 1854 from the Royal
  Botanical Garden of Hanover, under the name of <i>C. rostratus.</i>
  It blossoms in the Kew collection every June, the flowers lasting for
  several hours after sunrise. Seeds are freely ripened by this plant.
  Native of Antigua (?)</p>

  <p><b><a name="cmacd" id="cmacd">C. Macdonaldiae</a></b> (Mrs.
  MacDonald's); Bot. Mag. 4707.&mdash;A magnificent Cactus, producing
  flowers often 14 in. in diameter, with the same brilliant colours as
  are described under <i>C. Lemairii.</i> The stems are slender,
  cylindrical, not ridged or angled, bearing at irregular intervals
  rather fleshy tubercles instead of spines, and branching freely. Its
  flowers are produced on both young and old stems, several crops
  appearing in the course of the summer when the treatment is
  favourable. Roots are not so freely thrown out from the stems of this
  kind, and as the latter are slender and very pliant, they may be
  trained round a balloon trellis, so as to form handsome pot
  specimens, which, when in flower, may be carried into the house,
  where their large, beautiful flowers may be enjoyed. Writing of this
  species over thirty years ago, Sir Wm. Hooker said: "Certainly, of
  the many floral spectacles that have gratified lovers of horticulture
  at the Royal Gardens, Kew, of late years, few have been more striking
  than this to those who were privileged to see the blossoms in bud and
  fully expanded. The plant was received from Honduras through the
  favour of Mrs. MacDonald, and was planted at the back of the old
  Cactus-house, and trained against a wall. It first showed symptoms of
  blossoming in July, 1851. A casual observer might have passed the
  plant as an unusually large form of the 'night-blooming Cereus'
  <i>(C. grandiflorus),</i> but the slightest inspection of the stems
  and flowers, the latter 14 in. in diameter by 14 in. long, shows this
  to be a most distinct species."</p>

  <p><b><a name="cnapol" id="cnapol">C. Napoleonis</a></b>
  (Napoleon's); Bot. Mag. 3458.&mdash;This is very like <i>C.
  grandiflorus</i>, and is slightly and not very agreeably perfumed.
  The flowers sometimes open very early in the morning and fade in the
  afternoon, so that they may be enjoyed during the day-time. The
  flower tube is 6 in. long, curved upwards, and clothed with
  rose-tinted scales, which become gradually larger towards the top,
  where they widen out into a whorl of greenish-yellow sepals, above
  which are the white petals forming a broad shallow cup, 8 in. across,
  with a cluster of yellow stamens in the centre. The stems are
  three-angled, light green, and bear clusters of short stiff spines
  along the angles at intervals of 2 in. Flowers in autumn. Mexico (?),
  1835.</p>

  <p><b><a name="cnyct" id="cnyct">C. nycticalus</a></b> (flowering at
  night); Fig. 15.&mdash;Stems four to six-angled, 2 in. wide, dark
  green, bearing little tufts of hair and thin white spines along the
  angles, and a profusion of aerial roots. Flowers as large as those of
  <i>C. grandiflorus</i>; tube covered with tufts of white hairs;
  sepals or outer whorl of segments bright orange, the inner pure
  white, and arranged like a cup. They open at about seven o'clock in
  the evening, and fade at seven on the following morning. This plant
  may still be met with in some old-fashioned gardens, but only rarely
  as compared with its popularity a generation ago, when it was to be
  found in almost every collection of stove plants. At that time, the
  flowering of this Cactus was looked upon as an event, and it was
  customary for the owner to invite his friends to meet and watch the
  development of the flowers, and enjoy to the full their almost
  over-powering but delicious fragrance. So bright are the colours of
  the flowers, that a sort of luminosity seems to surround them when at
  their best. Flowers in autumn. Mexico, 1834.</p>

  </div>

  <p><b><a name="ctria" id="ctria">C. triangularis</a></b>
  (three-angled); Bot. Mag. 1884.&mdash;This plant is easily recognised
  because of its stout triangular stems, which increase at a rapid rate
  and bear roots freely; by means of these roots they cling to almost
  any substance with which they come in contact. There are large
  examples of it in the Kew collection, where it bears numerous flowers
  annually, which open in the evening and close at about eight o'clock
  next morning. The flowers measure 1 ft. in length by about the same
  in width of cup, and are composed of a whorl of long narrow green
  sepals, with pale brown points, a cluster of pure white petals,
  bright yellow stamens, and a large club-like stigma; they appear in
  autumn. Mexico. This species was cultivated at Hampton Court in
  1690.</p>

  <p><b><a name="cspec" id="cspec">C. speciosissimus</a></b> (most
  beautiful).&mdash;Although not a night-flowering kind, nor yet a
  climber, yet this species resembles in habit the above rather than
  the columnar-stemmed ones. It is certainly the species best adapted
  for cultivation in small greenhouses or in the windows of
  dwelling-houses, as it grows quickly, remains healthy under ordinary
  treatment, is dwarf in habit, and flowers freely&mdash;characters
  which, along with the vivid colours and large size of the blossoms,
  render it of exceptional value as a garden plant. Its stems are
  slender, and it may be grown satisfactorily when treated as a wall
  plant. For its cultivation, the treatment advised for Phyllocactuses
  will be found suitable. When well grown and flowered it surpasses in
  brilliancy of colours almost every other plant known. Specimens with
  thirty stems each 6 ft. high, and bearing from sixty to eighty buds
  and flowers upon them at one time, may be grown by anyone possessing
  a warm greenhouse. The stems are three to five angled, spiny, the
  tufts of spines set in little disks of whitish wool. The flowers are
  as large as tea saucers, with tubes about 4 in. long, the colour
  being an intense crimson or violet, so intense and bright as to
  dazzle the eyes when looked at in bright sunlight. When cut and
  placed in water they will last three or four days. April and May.
  Mexico, 1820. "Numberless varieties have been raised from this
  Cereus, as it seeds freely and crosses readily with other species.
  Many years ago, Mr. D. Beaton raised scores of seedlings from crosses
  between this and <i>C. flagelliformis,</i> and has stated that he
  never found a barren seedling. Much attention was given to these
  plants about fifty years ago, for Sir E. Antrobus is said to have
  exhibited specimens with from 200 to 300 flowers each. I have been
  informed that an extremely large plant of this Cereus, producing
  hundreds of flowers every season, is grown on the back wall of a
  vinery at the Grange, Barnet, the residence of Sir Charles Nicholson,
  Bart." (L. Castle).</p>

  <h3>THE SEMI-SCANDENT SPECIES.</h3>

  <p>These are characterised by a thin, drooping or trailing stem, and,
  though not strictly climbers, they may most fittingly be considered
  in a group by themselves. Some botanists have made a separate genus
  for them, viz., Cleistocactus, but for all practical purposes they
  may be grouped under the above heading, whilst popularly they are
  known as the Rat's-tail or Whipcord Cactuses. Two of them&mdash;viz.,
  <i>C. flagelliformis</i> and <i>C. Mallisoni</i>&mdash;are generally
  grafted on the stem of some erect, slender Cereus or Pereskia, or
  they may be worked on to the stem of a climbing Cereus, such as <i>C.
  triangularis</i>, in such a way as to hang from the roof of a house.
  A large specimen of <i>C. flagelliformis</i>, growing from the
  climbing stem of <i>C. rostratus</i>, was, for a long time,
  conspicuous among the Cactuses at Kew, but owing to the decay of the
  "stock" plant, this fine specimen no longer exists. A large Pereskia,
  trained along the roof in the Cactus-house at Kew, has recently been
  grafted with a number of pieces of <i>C. flagelliformis</i>, which in
  a few years will, no doubt, form a handsome specimen. In the same
  establishment a specimen of <i>C. Mallisoni</i> is grafted on the
  stem of another kind, and is very attractive when in flower. <i>C.
  serpentinus</i> thrives well upon its own roots. For the cultivation
  of this little group, the instructions given for the climbing and
  other kinds may be followed.</p>

  <p><b><a name="cflag" id="cflag">C. flagelliformis</a></b>
  (whip-formed).&mdash;Stems prostrate, or, when grafted on a tall
  stem, pendent, &frac12; in. in diameter, round, with numerous ridges
  almost hidden by the many clusters of fine bristle-like hairs.
  Flowers 2 in. long and 1 in. wide; colour bright rosy-red. In some
  parts of Germany this plant is one of the commonest of window
  ornaments, and it is so well grown by the peasants there, that the
  whole window space is completely screened by the numerous long,
  tail-like stems, 4 ft. or 6 ft. long, which hang from baskets. It is
  sometimes cultivated by cottagers in England, and we have seen a very
  fine specimen in a cottager's window in Gunnersbury. Without its
  pretty bright-coloured flowers, this Cactus has the charm of novelty
  in the form and habit of its stems, and as it is easily cultivated in
  a window through which the sun shines during most of the day, it is
  just the plant to grow for the double purpose of a screen and a
  curiosity. If planted in baskets, it should be potted in a porous
  loamy soil, and kept moist in the summer and perfectly dry in winter.

  <p><b><a name="cmall" id="cmall">C. Mallisoni</a></b> ( Mallison's);
  Bot. Mag. 3822.&mdash;This is supposed to be of hybrid origin, a Mr.
  Mallison having sent it to Dr. Lindley to be named, and stating that
  he obtained it by fertilising flowers of <i>C. speciosissimus</i>
  with pollen from <i>C. flagelliformis.</i> Whatever its origin, it is
  a distinct kind, with stems similar to those of the last-named, but
  thicker and slightly less spiny, and flowers 4 in. long by 4 in.
  across the spreading petals, the whole being bright red with a
  cluster of pale yellow stamens protruding 1 in. beyond the throat.
  The flowers are produced from the sides of the stems, a few inches
  from the apex, and as they are borne in abundance and last three or
  four days each, a large specimen makes a very attractive display for
  several weeks in the summer. The plant at Kew, a large one, is
  grafted on the stem of <i>C. Macdonaldiae</i>, which is trained along
  a rafter, so that the stems of <i>C. Mallisoni</i> hang conspicuously
  from the roof.</p>

  <p><b><a name="cserp" id="cserp">C. serpentinus</a></b>
  (serpent-like); Fig. 16.&mdash;When young, the stems of this plant
  are erect and stout enough to support themselves; but as they
  lengthen they fall over and grow along the ground, unless supported
  by a stake or wire; they have numerous ridges, with clusters of
  hair-like spines, which are usually purplish. Flowers large,
  handsome, fragrant; tube 6in, long, green; petals and sepals
  spreading and forming a star 3 in. in diameter, the petals purplish
  on the outside, and pinkish-white inside; stamens arranged in a sort
  of cup 1 in. deep. This plant rarely produces aerial roots. Small
  specimens are ornamental even when not in flower, the bright green,
  regularly ridged stem, with its numerous little clusters of fine
  spines, at the base of which are short tufts of a white woolly
  substance, being both curious and pretty. It flowers freely every
  summer. South America, 1814.</p>

  <h3>THE GLOBOSE AND COLUMNAR STEMMED SPECIES.</h3>

  <p>Many of these are unsuited for culture in ordinary plant-houses,
  whilst others are so rare that, although cultivated in botanical
  collections, they are not available for ordinary gardens, not being
  known in the trade. There are, however, a good many species that may
  be obtained from dealers in Cactuses, and to these we shall confine
  ourselves here. At Kew, the collection of Cereuses is large and
  diversified, some of the specimens being as tall as the house they
  are in will allow them to be, and the appearance they present is, to
  some eyes at least, a very attractive one. Such plants are: <i>C.
  candicans</i>, which is a cluster-stemmed kind, very thick and
  fleshy, and in shape like an Indian club; <i>C.
  chilensis</i>;&mdash;with tall hedgehog-skinned stems, the numerous
  ridges being thickly clothed with clusters of yellowish spines, which
  become dark brown with age; <i>C. Dyckii</i>, 10 ft. high, the stems
  thick and fleshy, with ridges 1&frac12; in. deep; <i>C. gemmatus</i>,
  a hexagonal, almost naked-stemmed species 10 ft. high; <i>C.
  strictus, C. peruvianus, C. geometrizans</i>, and <i>C. Jamacaru</i>,
  which are tall, weird-looking plants, 10 ft. or more high, some of
  them freely branched. The following is a selection of the
  largest-flowered and handsomest kinds:</p>

  <p><b><a name="cberl" id="cberl">C. Berlandieri</a></b>
  (Berlandier's); Fig. 17.&mdash;A distinct and beautiful plant, of
  dwarf, creeping habit, forming a tuft of short branchlets springing
  from the main procumbent stems, none of which exceed 6 in. in length
  by &frac34; in. in thickness. They are almost round when old, the
  younger ones being slightly angled, and bearing, along the ridges,
  little tubercles, crowned with short spines. Even old stems are very
  soft and watery, and, on this account, it is necessary for the safety
  of the plant, in winter, that it should be kept absolutely dry. The
  flowers are produced on the young upright stems, and they are as much
  as 4 in. across. They are composed of a regular ring of strap-shaped,
  bright purple petals, springing from the erect bristly tube, and in
  the centre a disk-like cluster of rose-coloured stamens, the stigma
  standing well above them. In form the flowers are not unlike some of
  the Sunflowers or <i>Mutisia decurrens</i>. They are developed in
  summer, and on well-grown plants the display of blossom is
  exceptionally fine. This species is sometimes known as <i>C.
  repens</i> and <i>C. Deppii</i>. It is a native of South Texas and
  Mexico, where it is found growing in sandy or gravelly soils, on dry,
  sunny hill-sides. It should be grown in a cool greenhouse or frame,
  in a position where it would get plenty of sunshine to ripen its
  growth and induce it to flower. In winter it should be placed close
  to the glass, where the sun can shine full on it, and where it will
  be safe from frost. It will not thrive if wintered in a warm house.
  In April, it should be examined, repotted if the soil is sour, and
  kept watered as growth commences.</p>

  <p><b><a name="cblan" id="cblan">C. Blankii</a></b> (Blank's); Fig.
  18.&mdash;This is very similar to the <i>C. Berlandieri</i> in habit
  and stem characters, differing only in having longer, broader, less
  spreading petals, a club-shaped stigma, and in the colour, which is a
  deep rose, flushed in the throat with crimson. A comparison of the
  figures here given will show the differences better than any
  description. <i>C. Blankii</i> comes from Mexico at high elevations,
  and thrives under cultivation with the same treatment as the
  preceding. It is very common in Continental gardens, where it is
  grown out-of-doors, being protected from cold in winter by a
  handlight and straw. It flowers in summer.</p>

  <p><b><a name="ccaer" id="ccaer">C. caerulescens</a></b>
  (blue-stemmed); Bot. Mag. 3922.&mdash;An erect-growing, tall Cactus,
  rarely branching unless made to do so by cutting off the top of the
  stem; furrows and ridges about eight, the ridges prominent, waved,
  and bearing tufts of blackish wool, in which are set about a dozen
  black spines, &frac12; in. long; the stem when young and in good
  health is bluish in colour. Flowers springing from the ridges, about
  8 in. long, the tube covered with reddish-grey scales, which pass
  upwards into the sepals; petals spreading, white, the margins
  toothed, and forming a spreading top, not unlike a large white single
  Camellia; the stamens are arranged in a sort of cup, and are
  yellow-anthered, with a large rayed yellow stigma in the middle. In
  the <i>Botanical Magazine</i> it is stated that the flowers of this
  species are equal and even superior to those of <i>C.
  grandiflorus</i>; but we have not seen flowers such as would bear out
  that statement. This species is too tall-stemmed to be recommended
  for windows or small greenhouses; but where room can be afforded it,
  the attractive colour of its stems, together with the size and beauty
  of its flowers, should win it favour. It blossoms in summer,
  generally about July, and is a native of Mexico. Introduced in
  1841.</p>

  <p><b><a name="ccaes" id="ccaes">C. caespitosus</a></b> (tufted);
  Fig. 19.&mdash;A dwarf species, the stem not more than 8 in. high by
  about 4 in. in diameter, sometimes branched, or bearing about its
  base a number of lateral growths, which ultimately form a cluster of
  stems&mdash;hence the name. The bark or skin of the stem is
  greyish-green, and the ribs, of which there are from a dozen to
  eighteen, are thickly covered with clusters of whitish wool and
  spines, the latter rose-tinted, and radiating in all directions. The
  flowers are produced on the top of the stems, and are short-tubed,
  the tube clothed with little bundles of spines; spread of the petals
  (from thirty to forty in each flower), 4 in.; colour deep rose;
  anthers and stigma forming an eye-like cluster, the former yellow,
  and the latter bright green. Flowered at Kew for the first time in
  1882, but, although new to cultivation, it is becoming plentiful.
  Native of New Mexico and Texas. For windows or small greenhouses this
  is a most suitable plant, as it flowers freely and keeps in good
  health in an ordinary greenhouse temperature, always, however,
  requiring plenty of sunlight and rest during winter. By placing it
  upon a shelf near the glass from October to March, allowing it to
  remain perfectly dry, and afterwards watering it freely, the flowers
  should make their appearance early in summer. A plant with several
  stems, each bearing a large bright rose blossom, sometimes two,
  presents an attractive appearance.</p>

  <p><b><a name="ccirr" id="ccirr">C. cirrhiferus</a></b>
  (tendril-bearing).&mdash;A prostrate, branching-stemmed,
  small-growing kind, very proliferous, with roots along the main
  stems; branchlets upright, five-angled, with slightly raised points,
  or tubercles, upon which are ten short hair-like spines, arranged in
  a star, and surrounding three or four central erect spines, all
  whitish and transparent. Flowering branches erect, 4 in. high, by
  about 1 in. in diameter, bearing, near the apex, the large bright red
  flowers, nearly 4 in. in diameter, regular as a Sunflower, and
  lasting about a week. This species was introduced from Mexico in
  1847. It is one of the best-known and handsomest of this group. It
  requires similar treatment to C. <i>Berlandieri</i>.</p>

  <p><b><a name="ccten" id="ccten">C. ctenoides</a></b>
  (comb-like);</p>

  <p>Fig. 20.&mdash;Stem 3 in. to 5 in. high, and about 3 in. in
  diameter, egg-shaped, unbranched, rarely producing offsets at the
  base. Ribs fifteen or sixteen, spiral, with closely-set cushions of
  stiff, whitish spines, which interlace and almost hide the stem;
  there are from fourteen to twenty-two spines to each cushion, and
  they are &frac14; in. long. Flowers produced on the ridges near the
  top of the stem; tube short, spiny; petals spreading, like a
  Convolvulus, 3 in. to 4 in. across, bright yellow; stamens yellow,
  pistil white. The flowers expand at about 9 a.m., and close again
  soon after noon. They are developed in June or July. This species is
  a native of Texas, and is rare in cultivation. When not in flower it
  might easily be mistaken for <i>Echinocactus pectinatus</i>. It
  should be grown in a sunny position, in a warm house or pit, all
  summer, and wintered on a shelf, near the glass, in a temperature of
  from 45 degs. to 50 degs. during winter. Under cultivation it is apt
  to rot suddenly at the base, more especially when old. Should this
  happen, the rotten parts must be cut away, and the wound exposed to
  the air in a dry house for a week or two.</p>

  <p><b><a name="cenne" id="cenne">C. enneacanthus</a></b>
  (eight-spined); Fig. 21.&mdash;Stem seldom more than 6 in. high by
  less than 2 in. in diameter, cylindrical in shape, bright green,
  simple when young, tufted in old specimens. Ribs shallow, broad,
  irregular on the top, with spine-cushions on the projecting parts;
  spines straight, yellowish-white, semi-transparent, variable in
  length, longest about 1 in. There are frequently as many as twelve
  spines in a tuft, although the specific name implies eight spines
  only. Flowers on the ridges near the top of the stem, with spiny
  tubes, spreading petals of a deep purple colour, and yellow stamens
  and pistil. They are developed freely in June and July. This is a
  soft-fleshed species, from Texas; it is not easily kept in health,
  and is therefore rarely seen. It should be treated as advised for
  <i>C. ctenoides</i>. Neither of these plants will flower unless it is
  grown in a sunny position as near to the roof-glass as is
  possible.</p>

  <p><b><a name="cfend" id="cfend">C. Fendleri</a></b>
  (Fendler's).&mdash;One of the best of the dwarf-stemmed kinds. It has
  a pale green stem, about 6 in. high, rarely branching at the base,
  but often found growing in clusters. Ridges nine to twelve, running
  spirally round the stem, and bearing clusters of brown spines, some
  of them nearly 2 in. in length. Flowers composed of a tube 1 in.
  long, green, fleshy, and spiny, with a spreading cup-like arrangement
  of petals and sepals, 3 in. in diameter, and of a bright purple
  colour; stigma and anthers green. It produces its flowers in June. It
  was introduced from the mountainous region of New Mexico about five
  years ago, and has blossomed freely in several collections, notably
  in that of Mr. Loder, of Northampton, who has cultivated this and
  several other species from the same region in a sunny sheltered
  position out of doors, where, for several years, they have withstood
  winter's cold with no other protection than that afforded by an
  over-hanging wall. Mr. Loder says of <i>C. Fendleri</i> that it is
  the best of all Cactuses for cool treatment, as the flowers last more
  than a week, closing at night, and opening only in sunshine, when its
  rich purple colour is quite dazzling to the eye. It also blossoms
  freely under glass; but the colour of the flowers is not so vivid as
  when they are produced in full sunshine out of doors.</p>

  <p><b><a name="cgiga" id="cgiga">C. giganteus</a></b> (gigantic);
  Fig. 22.&mdash;This is the most colossal of all Cactuses, in which
  respect it is chiefly interesting. Its stem, when young, is very
  similar to that of other dwarfer species, whilst, so far as is known,
  its flowers have not been produced under cultivation. It grows very
  slowly, a plant 6 in. high being eight or ten years old, so that, to
  attain its full development, a very long time indeed is necessary.
  When young, the stems are globose, afterwards becoming club-shaped or
  cylindrical. It flowers at the height of 10 ft. or 12 ft., but grows
  up to four or five times that height, when it develops lateral
  branches, which curve upwards, and present the appearance of immense
  candelabra. The flowers are 4 in. or 5 in. long, and about the same
  in diameter. There is a small specimen, about 3 ft. high, in the
  succulent collection at Kew. The appearance of a number of tall
  specimens of this wonderful Cactus, when seen towering high above the
  rocks and scrub with which it is associated, is described by
  travellers as being both weird and grand. Judging by the slowness of
  its growth, the prospect of seeing full-sized specimens of this
  species in English gardens is a very remote one, unless full-grown
  stems are imported, and this is hardly possible. Native of Mexico and
  California.</p>

  <p><b><a name="cleea" id="cleea">C. Leeanus</a></b> (Lee's); Bot.
  Mag. 4417.&mdash;A dwarf plant, the stems not more than 1 ft. in
  height, and about 5 in. in diameter at the base, tapering gradually
  towards the top, so that it forms a cone; the furrows number about a
  dozen, and the ridges are &frac12; in. high, the angles sharp, and
  clothed with clusters of pale brown spines, the central one 1 in.
  long, the others much shorter. The flowers are produced on the top of
  the stem, four or five together, and are large, handsome, brick-red
  in colour, the tube 2 in. long, clothed with yellowish, green-tipped
  scales, and little clusters of hair-like bristles. The arrangement of
  the petals, and the cluster of yellow anthers in the centre, give the
  flowers the appearance of Camellias, if looked at from above.
  Introduced from Mexico by Mr. Lee, of Hammersmith, in 1848, and
  flowered soon afterwards at Kew, in summer. Being a native of the
  higher, more northerly regions of Mexico, this species needs only to
  be protected from severe frosts; it has been known to bear a little
  frost without injury. For windows and greenhouses it is a very
  desirable plant.</p>

  <p><b><a name="clept" id="clept">C. leptacanthus</a></b>
  (slender-spined); Fig. 23.&mdash;One of the most beautiful of all
  Cactuses, and one of the easiest to cultivate, the only drawback
  being that it rarely flowers under cultivation. In habit it is
  similar to C. <i>Berlandieri</i>. A plant 8 in. across bears about
  twenty short branches, each of which, under careful cultivation will
  produce several flowers in the months of May and June, and these,
  when expanded, last about eight days before withering; they close
  every afternoon, opening about ten o'clock in the morning. The petals
  are arranged in a single series, spreading so as to form a shallow
  cup, and are notched on the edges near the upper end. They are
  coloured a deep purple-lilac on the upper half, the lower part being
  white, like a large pied daisy. The stamens are pure white; the
  anthers orange-coloured, as also is the star-shaped stigma. The plant
  is a native of Mexico, and was introduced in 1860. It requires the
  same treatment as the preceding kinds. The illustration is sufficient
  to show the beauty of this little creeping Cactus, which, although so
  long known, is not grown in English gardens, though it is common
  enough in Continental collections.</p>

  in. to 8 in. long, and about the same across the spreading petals;
  tube clothed with small, hairy scales; the sepals long and pointed;
  petals 2 in. or more long, 1 in. wide, spreading out quite flat;
  stamens arranged in a ring, with the whitish-rayed stigma in the
  middle. This species flowers in autumn. It is a native of South

  <p><b><a name="cpauc" id="cpauc">C. paucispinus</a></b> (few-spined);
  Bot. Mag. 6774.&mdash;A dwarf-stemmed species of recent introduction,
  and one which, owing to the beauty of its flowers and the hardy
  nature of the plant, is certain to find much favour among growers of
  Cactuses. The stem is about 9 in. high, by 2 in. to 4 in. in
  diameter, the base much wider than the apex, the ridges irregular,
  very thick and rounded, giving the stem a gouty or tumid appearance.
  Upon the prominent parts of these ridges are stellate tufts of long,
  pale brown spines, some of them nearly 2 in. long, and each tuft
  containing about eight spines. When young, the stems are more like
  some of the Mamillarias than the Cereuses. The flowers are developed
  near the top of the stem, two or three opening together; they are
  composed of a tube 2 in. long, clothed with long spines and large,
  green, scaly sepals below, the latter gradually enlarging till at the
  top they become as large as the petals, which are 2 in. long, with a
  spread of nearly 3 in., rounded at the tips, and coloured deep
  blood-red, tinged with orange inside. The stamens are clustered
  together sheaf-like, with the dark green stigmas protruding through
  them. This is a native of New Mexico, whence it was introduced in
  1883, and flowered in May. Mr. Loder, of Northampton, has
  successfully cultivated it in a cool frame in the open air, and it
  has also grown well in the Kew collection when treated in a similar
  way. This suggests its hardiness and fitness for window cultivation.
  Owing to the watery nature of the stems, it is necessary that they
  should be kept quite dry during the winter.</p>

  <p><b><a name="cpent" id="cpent">C. pentalophus</a></b>
  (five-winged); Bot. Mag. 3651.&mdash;As the name denotes, the stem of
  this erect-growing, somewhat slender species has five very prominent
  sharp-edged ridges, along which are little clusters of small spines
  about &frac12; in. apart; the stem is 1 in. in diameter, and the
  angles are wavy. The flowers are about 3 in. wide, spreading, the
  petals, broad and overlapping, rose-coloured, except in the centre of
  the flower, where they become almost pure white; the anthers are
  yellow, whilst the colour of the rayed stigma is purplish-blue. A
  native of Mexico, introduced and flowered in 1838. For its
  cultivation, the temperature of a warm greenhouse is required, though
  during summer it may be placed in a sunny position in a frame out of
  doors. If grown in windows, it should be kept through the winter in a
  room where there is a fire constantly.</p>

  <p><b><a name="cperu" id="cperu">C. peruvianus</a></b>
  (Peruvian).&mdash;A tall-grower, the stems fleshy when young, and
  very spiny. The ridges on the stem number from five to eight, with
  stellate bundles, about 1 in. apart, of small, stiff black spines.
  The flowers appear upon the upper portion of the stem, and are 5 in.
  across, the petals pure white above, tinged with red below, and
  forming a large saucer, in the middle of which the numerous stamens,
  with yellow anthers, are arranged in a crown. There is something
  incongruous in the tall, spine-clothed, pole-like stem, upon which
  large, beautiful, water-lily-like flowers are developed, looking
  quite out of place on such a plant. Flowers in spring and early
  summer. It requires warm greenhouse or stove treatment. There are
  some fine examples of this species at Kew. A variety of this species,
  with a fasciated or monstrous habit, is sometimes cultivated.
  Introduced in 1830.</p>

  <p><b><a name="cplei" id="cplei">C. pleiogonus</a></b>
  (twisted-angled); Fig. 26.&mdash;An erect cylindrical-stemmed
  species, from 6 in. to 1 ft. high by 4 in. in diameter, with from ten
  to fourteen angles or ridges; these are somewhat tumid, and marked
  with depressions, from which the star-like clusters of spines spring,
  about a dozen spines in each cluster, the central one much the
  largest. The flowers are about 8 in. long, the tube being rather
  thick and cylinder-like, expanding at the top, so as to form a sort
  of cup, in which the petals are arranged in several rows, with the
  middle filled by the numerous stamens, surmounted by the club-like
  pistil. The colour of the flowers is purple-red. This species appears
  to have first found its way into cultivation through some Continental
  garden, its native country being unknown. It thrives only in a warm
  house, developing its flowers in summer.</p>

  (many-spined).&mdash;A newly-introduced species, from El Paso, in
  Mexico, where it is common on the sand ridges and stony hills. Stem
  10 in. high, 2 in. to 4 in. wide, pale green or glaucous, with about
  eight ridges, the spines being placed along the angles in clusters of
  half a dozen or so, and about &frac12; in. apart. The flowers are 2
  in. to 3 in. long; the tube spiny; the petals semi-erect and concave,
  rounded at the tip, and forming a shallow cup or wine-glass-like
  flower; the colour of the petals is deep blood-red. This beautiful
  Cactus is exceptional in the length of time its flowers remain
  expanded and fresh, lasting a week or more; and as the plant is very
  free flowering, there is usually a beautiful display of rich red
  blossoms for about six weeks. It may be grown in a cool greenhouse or
  window, requiring no artificial heat beyond what would be necessary
  to insure its protection from frost. It flowers in spring.</p>

  <p><b><a name="cproc" id="cproc">C. procumbens</a></b> (trailing);
  Fig. 27.&mdash;This is a very pretty little Cactus, with spreading
  prostrate stems, from which upright branches grow to a height of 3
  in. or 4 in.; they are &frac12; in. thick, generally only four-angled
  or square, with small spines in tufts along the angles. The flowers
  are developed on the ends of the branches, and are 3 in. long and
  wide, the sepals spreading and recurved, as in a Paris daisy, their
  colour being bright rose purple. The anthers form a corona-like ring,
  inclosing the upright, rayed stigma. A native of Mexico; flowers in
  May and June. In its native haunts we learn that this little Cactus
  is very free-flowering, but under cultivation in this country it
  flowers only rarely. It thrives best when grown in a dry, sunny
  greenhouse, and kept perfectly dry during autumn and winter. If
  allowed to get wet in that season, it is apt to rot, the stems being
  soft and watery.</p>

  Mag. 4443.&mdash;Stem erect, sometimes 3 ft. high, and about 4 in.
  wide, deeply furrowed, the furrows usually numbering about fourteen;
  the ridges tumid and irregular, and coloured a dingy glaucous-green.
  Spines embedded in a tuft of grey wool, about a dozen spines in each
  cluster, 1 in. long, a few of them only half that length. Flowers on
  the top of the stem, three or four opening together, each being 3 in.
  long and wide; the tube short and scaly, with overlapping sepals and
  saw-edged petals, which are white, slightly tinged with rose. Stamens
  filling the whole of the flower-cup, bright yellow. A native of
  Mexico, introduced in 1796, flowering in summer. This species was
  evidently a favourite many years ago, but it is rare with us now. It
  thrives in a house where the winter temperature does not fall below
  45 deg., requiring no water at that time, but a liberal supply in the
  summer when growth is being made, and all the sunlight possible. When
  without its star-shaped, handsome flowers, the stem is remarkably
  ferocious-looking, the spines upon it being quite as thick and as
  strong as on a hedgehog.</p>

  number, rounded, somewhat undulated, and bearing spine-tufts nearly 1
  in. apart; each tuft contains about ten spines, which are almost
  equal in length, fine, stiff, brown, and persistent; there is a
  little cushion of white wool about the base of the spines. Flowers
  produced on the side, within a few inches of the top of the stem;
  they are composed of a scaly tube, 4 in. long, a circular row of
  spreading, incurved, pale brown sepals, and two rows of broad,
  overlapping, snow-white petals; stamens white, with yellow anthers;
  stigma yellow. The flowers, developed in summer, are very beautiful,
  but, unfortunately, each lasts only a few hours. A native of the West
  Indies, and an old introduction to English gardens (1720), but rare
  in cultivation now. It requires the treatment of a stove all the year

  <h3>THE GENUS ECHINOCACTUS.</h3>

  <h5>(From <i>echinos</i>, a hedgehog, and <i>Cactus</i>.)</h5>

  <div class="figleft">
    <img src="images/fancy_M.jpg" width="50" height="113" alt="M" />
  </div><br />

  <p>ANY of the plants included in the genus Echinocactus are very
  similar in habit and stem-characters to the Cereus. Botanists find
  characters in the seed vessel (ovary) and in the seeds by which the
  two genera are supposed to be easily separable; but, so far as can be
  made out by a comparison of their more conspicuous characters, there
  is very little indeed to enable one to distinguish the two genera
  from each other when not in flower. A comparison of the figures given
  in these pages will show that such is the case.</p>

  <p>The name Echinocactus was given to <i>E. tenuispinus</i>, which
  was first introduced into English gardens in 1825. The spiny
  character of this species is surpassed by that of many of the more
  recently introduced kinds; still it is sufficient to justify its
  being compared to a hedgehog. Some of the kinds have spines 4 in.
  long, broad at the base, and hooked towards the point, the hooks
  being wonderfully strong, whilst in others the spines are long and
  needle-like, or short and fine as the prickles on a thistle. The
  stems vary much in size and form, being globose, or compressed, or
  ovate, a few only being cylindrical, and attaining a height of from 5
  ft. to 10 ft. They are almost always simple&mdash;that is, without
  branches, unless they are compelled to form such by cutting out or
  injuring the top of the stem; the ridges vary in number from about
  five to ten times that number, and they are in some species very firm
  and prominent, in others reduced to mere undulations, whilst in a
  few, they are separated into numerous little tubercles or mammae. The
  species are nearly all possessed of spines, which are collected in
  bundles along the ridges of the stem. Generally, the flowers are
  about as long as wide, and the ovary is covered with scales or
  modified sepals. The fruit is succulent, or sometimes dry, and, when
  ripe, is covered with the persistent calyx scales, often surrounded
  with wool, and usually bearing upon the top the remains of the
  withered flower. The position of the flowers is on the young part of
  the stem, usually being perched in the centre, never on the old part,
  as in some of the Cereuses. The flowers open only under the influence
  of bright sunlight, generally closing soon after it leaves them.</p>

  <p>The geographical distribution of the species, of which over 200
  have been described, extends from Texas and California to Peru and
  Brazil; they are in greatest abundance in Mexico, whence most of the
  garden kinds have been introduced. The conditions under which they
  grow naturally vary considerably in regard to temperature and soil;
  but they are all found in greatest numbers and most robust health
  where the soil is gravelly or sandy, and even where there is no
  proper soil at all, the roots finding nourishment in the clefts or
  crevices of the rocks. As a rule, the temperature in the lands where
  they are native is very high during summer, and falls to the other
  extreme in winter, some of the species being found even where frost
  and snow are frequent; the majority of them, however, require what we
  would call stove treatment.</p>

  <p>Turning now to a consideration of those kinds known as garden
  plants, we find that comparatively few of the species known to
  botanists are represented in English collections, though, perhaps, we
  may safely say that not one of the kinds known would be considered
  unworthy of cultivation except by those who despise Cactuses of
  whatever kind. Their flowers are conspicuous both in size and
  brilliancy of colour; and in the curious, grotesque, and even
  beautifully symmetrical shapes of their stems, one finds attractions
  of no ordinary kind. The stem of <i>E. Visnaga</i> shown at Fig. 48
  may be taken as an instance of this&mdash;apart from the cluster of
  star-like, bright yellow flowers seen nestling upon the top of their
  spine-protected dwelling, the whole suggesting a nest of young birds.
  This plant is indeed one of the most remarkable of the
  Echinocactuses, owing to the size and number of its
  spines&mdash;which are 3 in. long, almost as firm as steel, and are
  used by the Mexicans as toothpicks&mdash;and to the gigantic size and
  great weight of the stem. The following account of a large specimen
  of this species introduced to Kew in 1845, is taken from an article
  from the pen of the late Sir Wm. Hooker in the <i>Gardeners'
  Chronicle</i> of that year. This gigantic plant was presented to the
  nation, in other words to Kew, by F. Staines, Esq., of San Luis
  Potosi. Such was its striking appearance, that it was stated that, if
  exhibited in the Egyptian Hall, Piccadilly, some hundreds of pounds
  might be realised by it. In a letter from Mr. Staines, here quoted,
  our readers will perceive how difficult it often is to obtain living
  specimens of these plants from their native habitats. He writes: "I
  mean to have a large specimen of <i>E. Visnaga</i> deposited in a
  strong box, sending the box first to the mountain where the monsters
  grow, and placing it on the springs of a carriage which I shall
  despatch for that purpose. My monstrous friend cannot travel any
  other way, from his stupendous size and immense ponderosity, which
  cannot be adequately calculated for here, where the largest machine
  for conveying weights does not exceed sixteen arrobes, or 400lb. This
  enormous plant will require twenty men at least to place it upon the
  vehicle, with the aid of such levers as our Indians can invent. It
  grows in the deep ravines of our loftiest mountains, amongst huge
  stones; the finest plants are inaccessible to wheeled vehicles, and
  even on horseback it is difficult to reach them. I shall pack him
  carefully in mats before applying to his roots the crowbars destined
  to wrench him from his resting place of unknown centuries. He will
  have to travel 300 leagues before he reaches Vera Cruz." Being too
  large to be packed in a box, it was first surrounded with a dense
  clothing of the Old Man's Beard or Spanish moss (<i>Tillandsia
  usneoides</i>)&mdash;and a better covering could not have been
  devised&mdash;and well corded. Fifteen mats, each as large and as
  thick as an ordinary doormat, formed the exterior envelope. When
  unpacked on its arrival at Kew, this monster Cactus was seen as
  perfect, as green, and as uninjured as if it had been that morning
  removed from its native rocks, its long, rope-like roots arranged in
  coils like the cable of a ship. When placed in scales it weighed
  713lb., its circumference at 1 ft. from the ground was 4&frac12; ft.,
  and its total height, 8 ft. 7 in.; the number of ridges was
  forty-four, and on each ridge were fifty bundles of spines, four
  spines to each bundle. Thus there were 8800 spines or toothpicks,
  enough for the supply of an army. A still larger specimen was a year
  or so later successfully brought to Kew, and which weighed 1 ton; but
  this, as well as the smaller one, survived only a short time. There
  have been numerous other large specimens of this Cactus in English
  gardens lately, all of them, however, succumbing to the unfavourable
  conditions of our climate. Mr. Peacock, of Hammersmith, recently
  possessed two large plants of <i>E. Visnaga,</i> one of which weighed
  nearly 5cwt., and measured 8 ft. 6 in. in circumference.</p>

  <p><b>Cultivation.</b>&mdash;The soil for Echinocactuses should be
  similar to that recommended for the Cereuses, as also should be the
  treatment as regards sunlight and rest. It cannot be too clearly
  understood that during the period between October and March these
  plants should be kept perfectly dry at the root, and in a dry house,
  where the temperature would not fall below 50 deg. There is no
  occasion for re-potting the Echinocactuses every year, it being by
  far the safest plan to allow them to remain in the same pots several
  years, should the soil be fresh and the drainage perfect.</p>

  <p>All the larger-stemmed kinds may be kept in health when grown on
  their own roots; but for some of the smaller species it is a good
  plan to graft them upon the stem of some of the Cereuses, <i>C.
  tortuosus</i> or <i>C. colubrinus</i> being recommended for the
  smaller kinds, and for the larger <i>C. peruvianus</i>, <i>C.
  gemmatus</i>, or any one the stem of which is robust, and of the
  right dimensions to bear the species of Echinocactus intended to be
  grafted. Some growers prefer to graft all the small Echinocactuses
  upon other kinds, find certainly, when properly grafted, they are
  safer thus treated than if grown on their own roots. In grafting, the
  two stems (stock and scion) must be cut so that their edges meet, and
  in securing them two or three stakes must be placed in such a way as
  to afford support to the graft and hold it firmly in position.</p>

  <p><b>Propagation.</b>&mdash;Besides grafting, cuttings of the stems
  may be utilised for the multiplication of Echinocactuses, first
  removing the upper portion of the stem and putting it into soil to
  root, and afterwards, as lateral stems develop on the old stock, they
  may be cut away with a sharp knife, and treated in a similar manner.
  Should a plant become sickly, and look shrivelled and cankered at the
  base, it is always best to cut away the healthy part of the stem, and
  induce it to form fresh roots, thus giving it a new lease of life.
  Seeds of these plants may be obtained from dealers, more especially
  Continental nurserymen, and to watch the gradual development of the
  plant from the seedling is both interesting and instructive. The
  seeds should be sown in soil, and kept moist and warm; in about a
  month after sowing, the little pea-like, green balls will be seen
  pushing their way through the thin covering of soil, and gradually
  but slowly increasing in size, their spines also increasing in number
  and strength, the ridges forming according to the character of the
  species, till, finally, they assume the mature characters of the
  plant, both in stem and habit. The flowers, of course, appear
  according to the length of time it takes for the species to grow to
  flowering size.</p>

  <h3>SPECIES.</h3>

  <p><a name="ebrev" id="ebrev"><b>E. brevihamatus</b></a>
  (short-hooked).&mdash;Several kinds of Echinocactus are distinguished
  from the rest in having the ridges divided into tubercles, which are
  often globular and arranged in a spiral round the stem, as in the
  genus Mamillaria; to this section the present species belongs. The
  stem is almost sphere-shaped, from 4 in. to 6 in. high, the
  tuberculated ridges about &frac14; in. deep, and upon each tubercle
  is a tuft of about a dozen brown, radiating spines, with a long
  central one hooked at the point. The flowers are borne in clusters on
  the top of the stem, three or four opening together; they are 1 in.
  in length, and the same across the spreading petals, which are pink,
  shaded with deep rose. A native of the mountainous regions of South
  Brazil; introduced about 1850. Flowers in summer. This pretty little
  plant will thrive if placed upon a shelf in a greenhouse where it
  will have full sunshine during the greater part of the day. It grows
  very slowly, especially when on its own roots, but succeeds better
  when grafted on another kind.</p>

  <p><b><a name="ecent" id="ecent">E. centeterius</a></b>
  (many-spined); Bot. Mag. 3974.&mdash;This has a conical-shaped stem,
  6 in. high by 4 in. wide, with about fourteen ridges, which are
  notched, and bear star-shaped clusters of pale brown spines, &frac12;
  in. long. The blossoms are borne rather thickly on the summit of the
  stem, from six to nine flowers being sometimes open together; and as
  they are each nearly 3 in. across, and of good substance, they
  present an attractive appearance. The petals are of a deep
  straw-colour, with a reddish streak down the centre, and 1&frac12;
  in.long, with the apex notched or toothed. The stamens are spirally
  coiled round the stigma, which is club-shaped and white. This species
  is probably a native of Mexico, and was first flowered in England at
  Kew, in 1841. A cool, dry greenhouse suits it best; or it may be
  grown in a sunny room window where frost would not be allowed to
  reach it in winter. Unless subjected to very dry treatment during the
  winter months, and also kept in a position where all the sunlight
  possible would reach it&mdash;even when at rest &mdash;there is not
  much chance of this plant producing its large flowers. It may be kept
  alive by giving it uniform treatment all the year round, but it would
  never flower.</p>

  <p><a name="ecinn" id="ecinn"><b>E. cinnabarinus</b></a>
  (cinnabar-flowered); Bot. Mag. 4326.&mdash;This is another of the
  Mamillaria-like kinds, and is remarkable for the depressed form of
  its stem, which may be likened to a sea urchin, both in size and
  shape. Old plants are from 6 in. to 8 in. in diameter, and about 4
  in. high; the spiral formed by the tubercles rises very gradually,
  and each of the latter is surmounted by a tuft of strong, brown,
  radiating spines, imbedded in a little cushion of wool. The flowers
  spring from the outside of the depressed top of the stem, two or
  three opening together and forming a beautiful picture, both as to
  size and colour. The tube is short and green, with a row of long
  green sepals at the top, and above these the petals, which are 2 in.
  long, overlapping, recurved, the edges toothed, and the colour a
  brilliant cinnabar-red. The stamens are in two series, very numerous,
  and the anthers are bright yellow. Looking at the flattened, spiny
  stem, it seems impossible that such large, handsome flowers should be
  produced by it. A native of Bolivia; introduced about 1846. It
  blossoms in July, and may be grown on a shelf in a cool greenhouse,
  as advised for the <i>E. centeterius.</i></p>

  <p><b><a name="econc" id="econc">E. concinnus</a></b> (neat); Fig.
  29.&mdash;A small species with a globose stem, 2 in. high and 3 in.
  wide, and about twenty ridges, which are rounded, rather broad, each
  bearing about half-a-dozen little bunches of spines arranged in a
  star. The flowers are numerous, as large as, or larger than, the
  stem, being 3 in. long and broad, the tube covered with brown
  hair-like spines, and having a few reddish scales, whilst the petals
  are in several rows, overlapping, with pointed tips, and are coloured
  dark yellow with a red streak down the centre. Several flowers are
  sometimes developed together on a little stem, when they have the
  appearance of being much too large for so small a plant to support.
  The pale green of the stem and its brown spines contrast prettily
  with the handsome yellow flowers, which are brightened by the streaks
  of red on the petals and the clear red colour of the stigma. It is a
  native of Mexico, and was introduced about 1840, flowering early in
  summer. It requires a warm greenhouse temperature all the year round,
  with, of course, plenty of sunshine. It may be grafted on the stem of
  an erect-growing Cereus, such as <i>C. serpentinus</i> or <i>C.
  Napoleonis</i>, the stock to be not higher than 6 in., and about as
  wide as the plant of <i>E. concinnus</i> is at the base.</p>

  in little depressions along the margins of the ribs, five spines in

  flattened and shorter, the fifth, which is the longest, being placed
  in the top of the cushion. Flowers 2 in. across, daisy-like, produced
  in April and May; tube very short; sepals and petals linear,
  spreading, white, with a purple stripe down the centre; stamens red,

  <p><b><a name="ecorn" id="ecorn">E. cornigerus</a></b>
  (horn-bearing).&mdash;This remarkable plant, of which a portion is
  represented at Fig. 31, has the stoutest spines of all cultivated
  Cactuses, and their arrangement on the ridges of the stem is such as
  would withstand the attacks of all enemies. The broad tongue-like
  spine is purple in colour, and as strong as iron; the three erect
  horn-like spines yellow, and as firm as the horns of an antelope, to
  which they bear a resemblance. The stem is sphere-shaped, grey-green
  in colour, and is divided into from fourteen to twenty-one stout wavy
  ribs, upon which the spine tufts occur at intervals of about 2 in.
  The arrangement of the spines is shown in the illustration, as also
  is the position of the flowers, which are small, with narrow purple
  petals and brown-red sepals. The plant is a native of Mexico and
  Guatemala, and would require stove treatment. We have seen only small
  living examples, but according to descriptions and figures, the most
  interesting character it possesses is its spiny armament. It has been
  called <i>Melocactus latispinus</i> and <i>Echinocactus

  <p><b><a name="ecory" id="ecory">E. corynodes</a></b> (club-like);
  Fig. 32.&mdash;The stem of this is about as large as a Keswick Codlin
  apple, with the broad end uppermost, and the sides cut up into about
  a dozen and a half rather prominent sharp ridges, with bunches of
  <i>stout</i> yellow spines arranged, at intervals of about 1 in.,
  along the edges. The flowers, which are produced in a cluster on the
  top of the stem, form a crown of bright yellow petals, studded with
  scarlet eye-like stigmas. Each flower is 2 in. in diameter when fully
  spread out, cup-shaped, and composed of two or three rows of
  over-lapping petals. In the middle of these nestle the short stamens,
  and projecting well beyond them is the bright scarlet stigma, forming
  a beautiful contrast to the petals. This plant is a native of Mexico,
  and was introduced about the year 1837. It is also known in gardens
  under the names of <i>E. rosaceus</i> and <i>E. Sellowianus</i>.
  There was a pretty little specimen of this flowering in the Kew
  collection last year, and the opening and closing of the flowers, as
  the sunlight reached or receded from them, was almost as rapid as
  that observed in the daisy. The whole plant is so small, and, when in
  flower, so charming, that no one could fail to admire it. It requires

  running spirally round the stem. From each tubercle springs a
  radiating cluster of yellowish, hair-like spines. The flowers are
  numerous, 1 in. long and wide, the scales on the tube tipped with
  red, whilst the petals stamens, and stigma are an uniform bright
  ochre-yellow; so that, looked at from above, they suggest the flowers
  of the common marigold. A well-managed plant produces as many as
  half-a-dozen of these flowers together, which open out widely under
  the influence of bright sunlight. It is one of the hardiest of the
  genus, thriving well in a frost-proof house or frame. During winter,
  the atmosphere surrounding it should be as dry as possible; but in
  summer it likes plenty of moisture, and exposure to full sunshine. A
  variety of <i>E. Cummingii</i> was raised from seeds a few years ago
  by Mr. Daniel, of Epsom, the flowers of which were pale almost to
  whiteness. The type is said to attain a height of 8 in. in its native
  country, Bolivia, whence plants were introduced to Kew in 1847, and
  flowered in July.</p>

  <p><b><a name="ecyli" id="ecyli">E. cylindraceus</a></b>
  (cylindrical).&mdash;A large-growing kind, attaining a height of
  several feet, very broad, and, as the name denotes, cylindrical in
  shape. When large, the stem often develops lateral branches about its
  base. Cultivated plants of it are 6 in. high, the sides marked with
  about a score of ridges, upon which, arranged in a dense cluster, are
  the stout, strong spines, the longest of them 3 in. long, hooked, and
  projecting outwards, the shorter spreading and interlacing so as to
  form a sort of spiny network all round the stem. The flowers are
  yellow, 2 in. long, and are composed of a short, thick tube bearing
  from forty to fifty fringed sepals, and about half that number of
  petals, which are also fringed. There are as many as a dozen flowers
  opened together on stout, aged plants; it is, however, more because
  of the densely spinous stems than the flowers that this species has
  found its way into cultivation. It cannot be recommended for any
  except large collections, and where it can be grown in a stove
  temperature. It is a native of the hot deserts of Colorado, and was
  introduced about ten years ago. There are several healthy young
  specimens of it in the Kew collection.</p>

  <p><b><a name="eechi" id="eechi">E. echidne</a></b> (viper; probably
  in allusion to the fang-like spines).&mdash;This species is
  remarkable in having a stout cylindrical stem, 12 in. high by 8 in.
  wide, with about a dozen deep ridges; these are disposed spirally,
  and bear tufts of rigid, broad spines, 1 in. or more long, spreading,
  so as to interlace and form a wire-like network all round the stem.
  It may be mentioned here that an American naturalist has recently
  suggested that the object of these iron-like spines on the stems of
  many Cactuses, and more especially on the majority of the Hedgehog
  kinds, is not so much to defend the fleshy stems from browsing
  animals as to afford protection from the scorching rays of the sun,
  which would otherwise cause the stems to blister and shrivel; and the
  nature of the spiny covering of <i>E. echidne</i> seems to support
  such a view. As in many others, the clusters of spines in this plant
  have their bases embedded in a tuft of whitish wool. The flowers are
  developed near the centre of the top of the stem, and are of medium
  size, bright yellow, with whitish stamens; they are produced two or
  three together, in summer. This species is a native of Mexico; it
  thrives in a greenhouse where frost is excluded, but only rarely
  flowers with us under cultivation.</p>

  <p><b><a name="eemor" id="eemor">E. Emoryi</a></b> (Emory's); Fig.
  34.&mdash;This is a very large-stemmed kind, specimens having been
  found nearly 3 ft. in height and about 2 ft. in diameter. Smaller
  plants, such as are in English collections, have globose stems 1 ft.
  through, with about thirteen ribs, the ribs tuberculated, the
  tubercles large, and rounded; the spines are borne on the apex of the
  tubercles in star-shaped bundles of eight or nine, and are angled,
  often flat on the top side, articulated, with hooked points, whilst
  in length they vary from 1 in. to 4 in. The flowers are 3 in. long,
  the tube clothed with heart-shaped scales or sepals; the petals are
  red, with yellowish margins, spreading so as to form a beautiful,
  large, cup-like flower, with a cluster of deep yellow stamens in the
  centre. The flowering period is in the autumn, and the plant is a
  native of the Lower Colorado and California. Living plants of it have
  only recently been introduced into English collections. At Kew, it is
  cultivated in a warm greenhouse, where it is in good health. From
  accounts of it in its native haunts, it will, however, probably
  prefer a cool house in winter, and as much sun and warmth as possible
  in spring and summer; for we are told that during winter it is often
  subjected to severe frosts and heavy snowfalls, whilst in summer the
  fierce heat of the sun is such as to burn up all vegetation, except
  Cactuses and other similar plants.</p>

  <p><b><a name="egibb" id="egibb">E. gibbosus</a></b>
  (humped).&mdash;A small apple-like plant, not more than 4 in. high,
  with a depressed top, the lower part being narrowed. It has sixteen
  ribs or ridges, composed of rows of thick fleshy tubercles, upon
  every other of which are six or eight horny spines, 1 in. long. The
  flowers are pushed out from the edge of the depression on the top of
  the stem, and are large; the tube 1&frac12; in. long. The petals
  spread to a width of 3 in., and are arranged in several rows,
  overlapping each other, becoming smaller towards the centre of the
  flower, as in an aster; they are pure white, except for a tinge of
  red on the tips of the outer ones, the stamens being bright yellow.
  Two flowers are usually developed on a plant, generally in June. This
  species was introduced from Jamaica about 1808, by a nurseryman in
  Hammersmith; but as no Echinocactuses are wild in the West Indian
  Islands, it must have been introduced into Jamaica from some of the
  Central American States, or probably from Mexico. It may be grafted
  on to another free-growing kind with advantage, as it does not always
  keep healthy when on its own roots. It should be grown in a cool
  greenhouse, or in the window of a dwelling-room, always, however, in
  a position where it would get plenty of sunlight.</p>

  <p><b><a name="ehayn" id="ehayn">E. Haynii</a></b> (Hayne's); Fig.
  35.&mdash;An upright cylindrical-stemmed species, very much like a
  Mamillaria in the form and position of the tubercles and the numerous
  greyish hair-like spines arranged in a radiating ring on the top of
  each tubercle. The flowers are much longer than in any yet described,
  the tube being 6 in. in length, clothed with large sepals on the
  upper portion, and the petals are semi-erect with recurved points,
  and coloured a brilliant purple-red. A native of Peru, where it is
  found at high elevations, growing in crevices of rocks and exposed to
  full sunlight. With us it thrives in a warm greenhouse, producing its
  beautiful flowers in summer. Introduced about 1850.</p>

  <p><b><a name="ehexa" id="ehexa">E. hexaedrophorus</a></b> (tubercles
  six-sided); Fig. 36.&mdash;This plant is distinguished by the
  gouty-looking tubercles into which its broad, spiral ridges are
  divided, and which look as if they would suddenly burst like a
  blister if pricked with a pin. It grows about 4 in. in height, and is
  similar in form to what is shown in the accompanying figure, except
  that the top is usually flatter than here represented. The whole stem
  has a glaucous hue, and the spines are reddish-brown. The flowers,
  which are produced freely in June and July, are short-tubed,
  spreading to a width of 2 in.; the petals toothed at the tips, and
  arranged in several rows, overlapping each other, the colour being
  white, tinted with rose, with a disk-like cluster of yellow stamens
  in the centre, and a white-rayed stigma. A native of North Mexico,
  introduced about 1830. It is very slow-growing, attaining full size
  in not less than six years from seed; indeed, it is stated that in
  twelve years a plant of it did not grow more than 2 in. Still, slow
  as it is, it remains in good health when kept in a sunny position on
  a shelf in a greenhouse or in a dwelling-room, so that it may be
  recommended for places where space is very limited. Like <i>E.
  gibbosus</i>, it does best when grafted on to another kind. We have
  seen perfect "drum-sticks" formed by grafting a full-grown plant of
  this on the stem of a Cereus.</p>

  the top, and divided into eight or nine large ribs or ridges,
  grey-green in colour. Spines in crowded star-shaped clusters along
  the apex of the ribs, seven spines in each cluster, all of them
  strong, slightly curved, horn-like, and marked with numerous rings;
  they are yellow, tipped with red when young, ash-coloured when old;
  the longest are about 2 in. in length. Flowers terminal, springing
  from the young spine tufts, each 4 in. across, with two rows of
  petals arranged regularly in the form of a cup; colour deep rose,
  paler on the inside of the cup; stamens very numerous, with white
  filaments and yellow anthers. The flowers expand at sunrise and close
  again in the evening, each one lasting about a week; they are very
  agreeably scented. Flowering season, May and June. The plant is a
  native of Mexico, and was introduced in 1838. (Syns. <i>E. equitans,

  <p><b><a name="eleco" id="eleco">E. Le Contei</a></b> (Le Conte's);
  Fig. 38.&mdash;Another of the large-stemmed kinds, which have only
  recently found their way into English gardens, although long since
  discovered and described by American travellers. The illustration
  represents a young plant. When full-grown, this species has a stem 5
  ft. high by 2 ft. wide, with broad deep channels and ridges, wrinkled
  and covered with a thick network of stout spines, which are set in
  clusters in a cushion of whitish wool, the longest being about 3 in.
  in length, with curved or slightly hooked points, and distinctly
  angular. The flowers are 2 in. long, bell-shaped; the petals shining
  lemon-yellow, with a tinge of brown on the outside, whilst the sepals
  are like a number of fish-scales, overlapping each other down the
  outside of the campanulate tube. The stamens and pistil are almost
  hidden inside the flower. Flowers are borne by quite young plants,
  whilst upon full-grown specimens they are so numerous as to form a
  large yellow cap to the immense, prickly, conical stems. They are
  developed in August and September. A native of Mexico, where it is
  found wild on the rocky or gravelly plains and ravines, and often in
  crevices of perpendicular rocks. It requires warm greenhouse
  treatment, and plenty of water during the summer, care being taken
  that the soil it is planted in is perfectly drained.</p>

  <p><b><a name="eleea" id="eleea">E. Leeanus</a></b> (Lee's); Bot.
  Mag. 4184.&mdash;This species has many characters in common with
  <i>E. hexaedrophorus</i> and <i>E. gibbosus</i>, the stem being no
  larger than a small orange, with plump globose tubercles, bearing
  star-shaped clusters of short brown spines. The flowers are 1&frac12;
  in. long and wide, and are composed of a green fleshy tube, with a
  few whitish scales, which gradually enlarge till, with the white,
  rose-tipped petals, they form a spreading cup, the large cluster of
  pale yellow stamens occupying the whole of the centre. This pretty
  little Cactus was raised from seeds by Messrs. Lee, of the
  Hammersmith Nursery, in 1840. It is a native of the Argentine
  Provinces, and flowers in May. The treatment recommended for <i>E.
  gibbosus</i> will be found suitable for this. It is happiest when
  grafted on to another kind. For the amateur whose plants are grown in
  a room window or small plant-case, these tiny Hedgehog Cactuses are
  much more suitable than larger kinds, as they keep in health under
  ordinary treatment, and flower annually; whereas, the larger kinds,
  unless grown in properly-constructed houses, rarely blossom.</p>

  <p><b><a name="elong" id="elong">E. longihamatus</a></b>
  (long-hooked); Fig. 39.&mdash;We heartily wish all species of
  Cactaceous plants were as readily distinguished and as easily defined
  in words as in the present remarkably fine and handsome one
  &mdash;remarkable in the very prominent ridges, the large and
  regularly-arranged spines, the central one very long, flattened, and
  usually hooked at the end, and handsome in the size and colouring of
  its flowers, both in the bud and when fully expanded. The stem is
  globose, 8 in. or more high; it has about thirteen prominent rounded
  ridges with waved tumid edges, from which, about 1&frac12; in. apart,
  spring clusters of spines, about a dozen in each cluster, dark red
  when young, becoming brown with age. In length, these spines vary
  from 1 in. to 6 in., the latter being the length of the central,
  hooked one, which is broad and flattened at the base. The flowers are
  4 in. broad and long, the tube short, green, and bearing reddish
  scales, which gradually pass into bright yellow petals blotched with
  red on the outside, the inner ones spreading and forming a shallow
  cup, in the centre of which are the short yellow stamens and large
  pistil. Plants of this species have been grown with stems 20 in.
  high; but it takes a great number of years for the development of
  such specimens. The flowers are produced on the apex of the stem in
  July. This species was introduced from Mexico about 1850; it thrives
  only when grown in a warm greenhouse, where the temperature in summer
  may be allowed to run up to 90 degs. with sun heat. For large
  collections it is one of the most desirable.</p>

  <p><b><a name="emack" id="emack">E. Mackieanus</a></b> (Mackie's);
  Bot. Mag. 3561.&mdash;A small plant, not more than about 5 in. high,
  and 2 in. broad at the base, widening slightly upwards. The ridges
  are broken up into numerous fleshy, rounded, green tubercles, crowned
  with a tuft of thin brown spines from &frac12; in. to 1 in. long,
  their bases set in a small pad of yellow wool: As the stem gets
  older, it loses its tubercles at the base, which are changed into
  brown wrinkles. The flowers are developed on the top of the stem,
  generally two or three together, egg-shaped and scaly when in bud,
  2&frac12; in. across when expanded; the petals white, tipped with
  brown; the stigma green, club-shaped. This curious little Cactus is
  one of about a dozen species found in the Chilian Andes. It was
  introduced in 1837 by the gentleman whose name it bears, and who, at
  that time, possessed a famous collection of Cacti. Like the rest of
  the Chilian kinds, it should be cultivated in a cool greenhouse in
  full sunshine, where it will produce its flowers in summer.</p>

  <p><b><a name="emami" id="emami">E. mamillarioides</a></b>
  (Mamillaria-like); Bot. Mag. 3558.&mdash;This is another small,
  tubercled species, which, like the preceding, is a native of Chili.
  Its stem is very irregular in form, owing to the crowding of the
  tubercles, which look as if they were filled with water. The spines
  are small, in tufts of about half a dozen, set in a little cushion of
  yellowish wool. In size, the whole plant is like <i>E.
  Mackieanus</i>, but it blossoms more freely, as many as sixteen
  flowers having been borne at one time by a plant at Kew. These were
  short-tubed, the calyx clothed with green scales, and the petals 2
  in. long, recurved at the apex, forming a beautiful cup-like flower
  of a bright yellow colour, with a band of red down the centre of each
  petal; the stamens and pistil yellow. The number of flowers developed
  on the small stem formed by this plant is quite extraordinary. It
  grows and flowers freely in an ordinary greenhouse, and would thrive
  in a sunny window if kept dry during the winter.</p>

  <p><b><a name="emamil" id="emamil">E. mamillosus</a></b>
  (nipple-bearing).&mdash;A short, dumpy plant, with numerous tubercled
  ridges, bearing bunches of dark brown hair-like spines, which form a
  close network about the stem. The flowers are developed on the top of
  the stem, and are about 4 in. in diameter, with a thick tube; the
  petals are spreading, bright yellow in colour, and arranged in a
  regular, bell-like whorl. Inside this bell is a circle of purple
  filaments or stamens, forming a pretty contrast with the clear yellow
  of the petals. This is a recent introduction, which flowered in the
  Kew collection for the first time in June, 1886. It is one of the
  most beautiful of the large-flowered kinds, and, as it thrives in a
  warm greenhouse and is very free-flowering, it may be expected to
  become a favourite with Cactus growers. Owing to the lack of
  information respecting the conditions under which many of the
  Cactuses are found wild, and to the fact that little in the way of
  experimental culture has been done by growers of this family,
  cultivators are sometimes in the dark as regards the lowest
  temperature in which the rarer kinds can be safely grown. Many of the
  species of the present genus, for instance, were grown in stoves
  years ago but are now known to thrive in a cool greenhouse where
  frost alone is excluded.</p>

  <p><b><a name="emult" id="emult">E. multiflorus</a></b>
  (many-flowered); Bot. Mag. 4181.&mdash;A well-named Cactus, as its
  small stem (seldom more than 5 in. high, and the same in width) often
  bears a large cap-like cluster of beautiful white flowers, except for
  a slight tinge of brown on the tips of the petals. Each flower is
  composed of a green, scaly tube, and several rows of reflexed petals,
  which form a shallow cup 2&frac12; in. across. The stamens are tipped
  with orange-coloured anthers, and the stigma is rayed and snow-white.
  The stem is ridged with rows of fleshy mammae or tubercles, which are
  curiously humped, and each bears a cluster of spreading, brown
  spines, 1 in. long. The number of flowers this little plant annually
  produces seems more than could be possible without proving fatal to
  its health; but we have seen it blossom year after year, and in no
  way has its health appeared impaired. It may be grown on a shelf in a
  warm greenhouse, or in the window of a heated dwelling-room.
  Introduced, probably from Mexico, in 1845. This, like all the small,
  globular-stemmed kinds, may be grafted on the stem of a Cereus of
  suitable thickness. Some cultivators believe that grafting causes the
  plants to flower more freely, but we have not observed any difference
  in this respect between grafted and ungrafted plants.</p>

  <p><b><a name="emyri" id="emyri">E. myriostigma.</a></b>
  (many-dotted); Fig. 40.&mdash;In the form of the stem of this species
  we have a good illustration of how widely a plant may differ from
  others of the same genus in certain of its characters, for the spines
  are almost totally suppressed, and the ridges are regular, deep, and
  smooth. There are usually five or six ridges, a transverse section of
  the stem revealing a form exactly like the common star-fish
  (Astrophyton), a resemblance to which the name Astrophytum, sometimes
  applied to this plant, owed its origin. The form of the stem is well
  represented in the Figure. The white dots shown on the bark, and
  which look like scales, are composed of very fine interwoven hairs,
  which, under a microscope, are very pretty objects. This species was
  introduced from Mexico along with the large plant of <i>E.
  Visnaga</i> described at the beginning of this chapter, and was first
  flowered at Kew, in July, 1845. Stems 1 ft. in length were received,
  along with shorter ones; but only the small ones were established.
  The flowers are daisy-like, 1&frac12; in. across, and are
  straw-coloured, the petals being tipped with black. It thrives under
  warm greenhouse treatment. When without its flowers, it looks more
  like a piece of chiselled stone than a living plant.</p>

  <p><b><a name="eobva" id="eobva">E. obvallatus</a></b> (fortified);
  Fig. 41.&mdash;The form of stem in this species is shown in the
  Figure. It grows very slowly plants 4 in. through taking about ten
  years to reach that size from seeds. The spines are stout, all
  deflexed, and arranged along the edges of the numerous ribs into
  which the stem is divided. The flowers are developed from the centre
  of the plant, and are surrounded by the erect spines, which crown
  the, as yet, undeveloped tubercles. Two or three flowers are produced
  at about the same time, each one being composed of a short, spiny
  tube, and a whorl of erect petals, which are pointed,
  purple-coloured, paler at the margin, the stamens being yellow.
  Native of Mexico. It requires a stove temperature, and flowers in
  summer.</p>

  <p><b><a name="eotto" id="eotto">E. Ottonis</a></b> (Otto's); Bot.
  Mag. 3107.&mdash;A dwarf kind, with a balloon-shaped stem, rarely
  exceeding 4 in. in height, and divided into a dozen wide ridges with
  sharp, regular edges, along which are clusters of small, brown
  spines, set in little tufts of wool, and looking like an array of
  spiders. The flowers are borne on the tops of the ridges, and are
  pale yellow in colour, with a band of red hair-like spines
  surrounding the calyx just below the petals, which are narrow,
  spreading, and look not unlike the flowers of the yellow Marguerite;
  the stigma is bright red. The symmetrical form of the stem, with its
  rows of spider-like spines, renders this plant attractive, even when
  without its bright and pretty flowers. It thrives only in a warm
  stove. Introduced from Brazil in 1831, flowering in the month of
  July. As it produces young plants about its base, it may be easily
  propagated by removing them and planting them in soil; or they may be
  grafted as advised for other of the small, globose-stemmed kinds.</p>

  <p><b><a name="epect" id="epect">E. pectiniferus</a></b>
  (comb-bearing); Bot. Mag. 4190.&mdash;One of the most striking of the
  plants of this genus, owing to the character of its stem, and the
  large size and beauty of its flowers. The former resembles a pear
  with the thin end downwards; its height is from 4 in. to 6 in., and
  it has about twenty ridges, which are sharply defined and bear along
  their angles little cushions of white wool &frac12; in. apart, with a
  radiating cluster of brown spines springing from each. The
  arrangement of the spines in rows is not unlike the teeth of a comb.
  The flowers are borne near the top of the stem, and consist of a
  green, fleshy tube, clothed with spines and little tufts of white
  wool; the sepals form a row beneath the petals, and are yellowish,
  tinged with purple; petals 2 in. long, broad, with the upper margins
  toothed and the tip acute, their colour being bright rose, tinged
  with greenish-white at the base; stamens yellow; stigma large, green.
  The form of the flowers is that of a cup, nearly 3 in. across.
  Introduced from Mexico in 1845. Flowering season, April and May. It
  requires warm-house treatment.</p>

  <p><b><a name="epoly" id="epoly">E. polycephalus</a></b>
  (many-headed); Fig. 42.&mdash;Stem globose when young, becoming
  cylindrical with age; number of ribs varying from twelve to twenty,
  sharply defined, and bearing, at intervals of 1 in., clusters of
  stout, reddish spines, somewhat flattened on the upper side, and
  marked with raised rings, or, as it is termed, annulated, the central
  ones attaining a length of over 3 in. on old plants, and sometimes
  curved. The flowers are enveloped at the base in a dense mass of
  white wool, which hides the tube, its spines only showing through;
  petals narrow, 1 in. long, spreading like a saucer, and coloured
  bright yellow; stamens numerous, yellow, as also is the large rayed
  stigma. California and Colorado, on stony and gravelly hills. Flowers
  in spring; introduced to Kew in 1886. This new plant is remarkable in
  that it is often found wild with as many as twenty to thirty stems or
  heads springing from the same base, and even young plants show early
  a disposition to develop several heads. The largest stems are from
  1&frac12; ft. to 2&frac12; ft. high, and have a somewhat forbidding
  appearance, owing to the size and strength of their numerous spines.
  For its cultivation, a warm-house temperature appears most suitable;
  it bears a close resemblance to <i>E. texensis</i>.</p>

  <p><b><a name="epott" id="epott">E. Pottsii</a></b>
  (Potts').&mdash;The stem of this is shown in Fig. 43. Full-sized
  plants are 1&frac12; ft. in diameter, and have about a dozen ridges
  with acute sinuses, the ridges being rounded and even. The spines are
  1 in. long, bristle-like, and are arranged in clusters of seven or
  nine, with a cushion of white wool at the base of each cluster.
  Flowers short-tubed, about 2 in. across, and coloured yellow; they
  are produced on the top of the stem in summer, several expanding
  together. The plant is a native of California, and was introduced
  about 1840. Under cultivation this species proves to be a
  shy-flowering Cactus, although in a warm house it grows freely, and
  remains in good health. It is well adapted for grafting on to the
  stem of some kind of Cereus, and in this way may be made to look very
  singular, as was shown in Mr. Peacock's collection of succulents some
  years ago, when a fine specimen, over 1 ft. across, was successfully
  grafted on to three stems of <i>C. tortuosus</i>, and had much the
  appearance of a melon elevated on a short tripod.</p>

  <p><b><a name="erhod" id="erhod">E. rhodophthalmus</a></b>
  (red-eyed); Bot. Mag. 4486, 4634.&mdash;Stem cone-shaped, 4 in. to 1
  ft. high, deeply furrowed; ridges about nine, 1 in. high, the angles
  bearing closely-set clusters of radiating spines, with a projecting
  one in the middle of each cluster, which contains nine spines 1 in.
  long, purple when young, becoming white when old. The flowers are
  produced from the summit of the stem, and have a thick, green, scaly
  calyx tube, upon which the spreading, rose-coloured petals are
  arranged in a regular series, and form a shallow bell nearly 3 in.
  across. The throat of the flower is coloured a deep crimson, against
  which the little sheaf of white stamens and the star-shaped yellow
  stigma form a pretty contrast. Three or more flowers are expanded
  together on a plant. It is a native of Mexico; introduced in 1845. It
  thrives in a house or frame where it is protected from frost, and
  during summer gets plenty of sunlight and air. It flowers in August.
  During the months of April and May, when it starts into growth, it
  should be kept close; but by the end of June, it should be exposed to
  the open air and allowed to ripen, so that its flowers may be
  produced in the autumn. The plant called <i>E. v. ellipticus</i> does
  not differ from the type, owing its name to the form of the stem of
  the first plant that flowered at Kew.</p>

  <p><b><a name="escop" id="escop">E. scopa.</a></b> (brush-like); Fig.
  44.&mdash;The stem of this species, when seen covered with numerous
  tufts of bristly spines, has been compared to a brush, a comparison
  not, however, applicable to the form represented in the Figure. In
  height the stems sometimes reach l&frac12; ft., with from thirty to
  forty ribs, bearing little discs of white wool at the bases of the
  clusters of spines. The flowers spring from the upper part of the
  stem (the nodules shown in the illustration represent the places
  where flowers have been developed at an earlier stage of growth),
  from four to six being borne in the same season; they are 1&frac12;
  in. long and wide, the tube short and brown, bristly; the petals are
  arranged in several overlapping series, rather wide for their length,
  toothed at the ends; their colour is a bright sulphur-yellow, as also
  are the stamens, whilst the stigma, which is rayed, is bright
  crimson. Native of Brazil. Introduced about 1840; it is more like a
  Cereus, in the form of its stem, than an Echinocactus. It flowers in
  June, and requires stove treatment. The stems, when dried carefully
  and stuffed with wadding, form pretty ornaments.</p>

  Cactuses do not flower, but they are nevertheless interesting, and
  worth growing on account of their curious shapes. The plant shown in
  Fig. 45 is grafted on the stem of a Cereus, and it is remarkable that
  a portion of the crest of the Echinocactus will, if grafted on to
  another plant, develop the abnormal form of its parent, proving that
  the variation, whatever its cause, has become fixed.</p>

  <p><b><a name="esimp" id="esimp">E. Simpsoni</a></b>
  (Simpson's).&mdash;One of the smallest plants in the genus, and one
  of the prettiest. It produces tufts of irregularly-formed stems about
  4 in. high, and composed of numerous rounded tubercles over &frac12;
  in. wide, bearing on the top of each a tuft of about twelve spines
  &frac12; in. long. The flowers are borne from the apex of the young
  tubercles, and are 1 in. wide and long, cup-shaped; petals pale
  purple, the stamens yellow. Native of Mexico and Colorado, where it
  is found at elevations of 8000 ft. to 10,000 ft., in great abundance,
  forming large patches on gravelly morains, where the climate during
  the summer is dry, whilst in winter a thick covering of snow protects
  the plants from severe frosts. In England, this species is said to
  have withstood 32 degs. of frost without being injured. It has been
  grown out of doors in a garden at Northampton, where it passed
  several winters planted in a raised border at the foot of a south
  wall with a natural coping of ivy. In New York, where the frosts of
  winter are severer than in England, it is cultivated out of doors. In
  this country it is apt to be injured by excessive moisture and fogs;
  but by protecting it with a handlight from November to March or
  April, this is overcome. If grown in pots, it should be kept in a
  position where it can enjoy all the sunlight possible.</p>

  <p><b><a name="esinu" id="esinu">E. sinuatus</a></b>
  (undulated).&mdash;Stem about 8 in. wide and long; globose, bearing
  fourteen to sixteen ridges, the edges of which are wavy or undulated,
  the prominent points crowned with tufts of thin, flexuous, yellow
  spines, the longest 1&frac12; in., and hooked, the shorter &frac34;
  in., and straight. The stem of <i>E. longihamatus</i> is very similar
  to this. Flowers developed on the top of the stem; tube short, scaly,
  green; petals yellow, spreading, and forming a cup 3 in. across,
  which is greenish outside. A native of Mexico, where it flowers in
  April. A recently-introduced kind, not yet flowered in this country.
  It is described as being a distinct, large-flowered, handsome
  species.</p>

  <p><b><a name="etenu" id="etenu">E. tenuispinus</a></b>
  (thin-spined); Bot. Mag. 3963.&mdash;Stem globular, depressed, with
  ridges and spines similar to those of <i>E. Ottonis</i>; indeed, by
  some these two are considered forms of the same species. In the
  number and size of the flowers, their colour and form, and the time
  of flowering, there is no difference between them. Native of Mexico
  (and Brazil ?).</p>

  <p><b><a name="etexe" id="etexe">E. texensis</a></b> (Texan); Fig.
  46.&mdash;A short-stemmed plant, with a thick, leathery skin and
  broad-based ridges of irregular form, crowned with tufts of stout
  horny spines, the central one much the longest, flattened at the
  base, and strong as steel. The flowers are produced near the centre
  of the top, from the tufts of whitish wool which accompany the spines
  on the young parts of the ridges. They are 2&frac12; in. long and
  wide; the tube short and woolly; the petals spreading, beautifully
  fringed, and rose-coloured. Native of North-east Mexico, where it
  grows on stony hillsides in full exposure to sunshine, and where,
  during winter, it has to endure weather verging on to frost. It
  thrives in a greenhouse under cultivation. Like several of the
  stout-spined, robust-stemmed kinds, this may find favour as a garden
  plant because of the character of its stem, and the extraordinary
  strength of its large iron-like spines.</p>

  <p><b><a name="eturb" id="eturb">E. turbiniformis</a></b>
  (top-shaped).&mdash;A very distinct dwarf kind, with globular stems 2
  in. high and about 3 in. wide, clothed with spirally-arranged rows or
  ridges of tubercles, similar to those shown in the figure of <i>E.
  hexaedrophorus</i>, except that, in the former, there are no spines
  on the mature tubercles, although, when young, they have each a
  little cluster of fine spines. The flowers expand in June, several
  together, from the top of the stem; they are round, 1 in. across, the
  petals being numerous, pale yellow in colour, tinged with red on the
  outside. Introduced from Mexico, 1840. This curious little plant
  requires stove treatment, and thrives when grafted on the stem of
  some other kind. It is sometimes known as <i>Mamillaria
  turbinata</i>.</p>

  <p><b><a name="eunci" id="eunci">E. uncinatus</a></b> (hooked); Fig.
  47.&mdash;A small species, with oval stems when young, older plants
  becoming cylindrical, as shown in the accompanying Figure. The height
  of the largest plant does not exceed 6 in., so that, when wild, it is
  often hidden by the long grass in which it is frequently found on
  stony hillsides at high elevations, in Mexico. The ridges are broken
  up into large tubercles, upon each of which is a tuft of short
  straight spines, arranged in a circle, and a long hooked one
  springing from the centre, and often attaining a length of about 4
  in. In old plants the spines are almost white, whilst in young ones
  they are purplish. The flowers are borne in a cluster on the apex of
  the stem, and are nearly 2 in. long, the tube being short and spiny,
  and the petals numerous, arranged in a cup, their colour dark
  purplish-red, the tips pointed; the stamens are yellow, with orange
  tips. The flowers expand only when the sun shines on them, closing up
  again in dull light, but opening again, and remaining fresh for about
  a week. Introduced in 1850. Flowers in March and April. This plant
  may be grown in a cool, sunny greenhouse, or window, requiring only
  protection from frost in winter, and in summer plenty of light, with
  a moderate amount of water. There are several varieties of it
  described, their differences being chiefly in the shape of the
  stem.</p>

  <p><b><a name="eviri" id="eviri">E. viridescens</a></b>
  (greenish).&mdash;Stem 1 ft. high and 9 in. across, young plants
  being broader than high; the sides split up into about twenty ridges,
  which are again divided into knotty tubercles or waves. The spines
  are remarkable for their size and strength, those on large plants
  being 4 in. long by &frac12; in. broad at the base, gradually
  narrowing to a stiff point; there are four central spines of this
  size, the others, of which there are about a dozen, being shorter and
  thinner, and arranged stellately. The flowers, which are rarely
  produced, are poor in comparison with the majority of the flowers of
  this genus. As the name denotes, their colour is yellowish-green; and
  they are about 1&frac12; in. wide and high. There are often as many
  as a dozen flowers expanded together on a stem of this plant when
  wild, and they are arranged in a circle around the growing point. The
  interest in this species, however, centres in its spines rather than
  its flowers. It is a native of the dry hills of California, extending
  sometimes down to the sea-beach. There is a plant of it at Kew 6 in.
  high and about fifteen years old; it has not been known to flower
  there. Mr. Peacock also possesses a large plant of it.</p>

  <p><b><a name="evisn" id="evisn">E. Visnaga.</a></b> (visnaga means a
  toothpick among the Mexican settlers); Fig. 48.&mdash;Of the most
  remarkable features of this truly wonderful Cactus we have already
  spoken earlier in this Chapter. In 1846, Sir W. J. Hooker described,
  in the <i>Illustrated London News</i>, a large plant of it, which had
  been successfully introduced alive to Kew, and which, a year or so
  later, flowered, and was figured in the <i>Botantical Magazine</i>
  (4559). Its height was 9 ft., and it measured 9&frac12; ft. in
  circumference; its weight a ton. Afterwards, it exhibited symptoms of
  internal injury. The inside became a putrid mass, and the crust, or
  shell, fell in by its own weight. The shape of the stem is
  elliptical, with numerous ridges and stout brown spines arranged in
  tufts along their edges. The flowers are freely produced from the
  woolly apex; the tube is scaly and brown, and the petals are arranged
  like a saucer about the cluster of orange-coloured stamens. The
  colour of the petals is bright yellow, and the width of the flower is
  nearly 3 in. This plant is a native of Mexico, and is usually
  cultivated in a tropical temperature, but it would probably thrive in
  a warm greenhouse. It flowers in summer. As we have stated, large
  specimens do not live long in this country; and as the flowers are
  only borne by such, the plant, except only for its stems, is not to
  be recommended for ordinary collections.</p>

  <p><b><a name="ewill" id="ewill">E. Williamsii</a></b> (Williams's);
  Bot. Mag. 4296.&mdash;A very distinct dwarf species, often called the
  "Dumpling Cactus," from the puffed-out, tumid appearance of its
  stems, which frequently branch at the base, so as to form a tuft of
  several heads; these are turbinate, 3 in. or 4 in. high, and 2 in.
  across the top, where the smooth, pale green flesh is divided into
  about half-a-dozen rounded tubercles, pressed closely together, and
  suggesting a number of small green potatoes joined by their bases.
  Each tubercle bears several tufts of short hairs. The flowers proceed
  from the young tubercles near the centre of the crown, their bases
  being enveloped in pale brown wool, the petals spreading out
  daisy-like to the width of 1 in., with a short disk of stamens in the
  middle; they are white, tinged with rose, and are developed in the
  summer months. Native of the rocky hills of Mexico, whence it was
  introduced in 1845. The stems of this plant are its most distinctive
  feature. It thrives on a shelf in a warm greenhouse, if kept
  perfectly dry in winter, and it should be potted in a compost
  consisting of broken brick two-thirds, loam one-third.</p>

  <p><b><a name="ewisl" id="ewisl">E. Wislizeni</a></b> (Wislizen's);
  Fig. 49.&mdash;A large-stemmed kind, second only in size to <i>E.
  Visnaga.</i> Young plants have depressed stems, those in older
  specimens being cylinder-shaped. A specimen at Kew is 8 in. high by
  18 in. in diameter, with twenty-one ridges, which are regular and
  sharp-edged, and bear bunches of spines at regular intervals, the
  outer and shorter ones being spreading and white, whilst from the
  middle of each tuft arise four longer and stouter spines, three of
  them 2 in. long, and one 3 in., with the point hooked, and as strong
  as if made of steel. The flowers, which are developed only on large
  plants, are greenish-yellow, about 2 in. long and wide, and expand
  during summer and autumn. The juice of the stems is said to serve as
  a substitute for water when the latter is scarce, and instances have
  been known among the white trappers where the lives of men have been
  saved by this plant. A novel use the stems are put to by the Indians
  is that of boilers, a purpose which they are said to answer well. The
  fleshy inside is scooped out, and the tough skin, with its iron-like
  spine protection, is then filled with vegetables and water and placed
  on the fire. As there is a plentiful supply of plants, the Indians do
  not trouble to carry this "boiler" about with them, but make a fresh
  one at every stage of their journeyings.</p>

  <h3>THE GENUS ECHINOPSIS.</h3>

  <h4>(From <i>echinos</i>, a hedgehog, and <i>opsis</i>, like.)</h4>

  <div class="figleft">
    <img src="images/fancy_N.jpg" width="55" height="113" alt="N" />
  </div><br />

  <p>O less than three sections of Cactuses, viz., the above,
  Echinocactus, and Echinocereus, owe their names to their
  hedgehog-like stems. From a horticultural point of view, there is
  perhaps no good reason for keeping the above three genera and Cereus
  separate; but we follow Kew in the arrangement adopted here. The
  genus Echinopsis, as now recognised by most English botanists and
  cultivators, comprises about thirty species, most of which have been,
  or are still, in cultivation. They are distinguished from
  Echinocactuses by the length of their flower tube, from Cereuses by
  the form and size of their stems, and from both in the position on
  the stem occupied by the flowers. They are remarkable for the great
  size, length of tube, and beauty of their flowers, which, borne upon
  generally small and dumpy stems, appear very much larger and
  handsomer than would be expected.</p>

  <p>The distribution of Echinopsis is similar to that of Echinocactus,
  species being found in Chili, Bolivia, Peru, Brazil, Mexico, &amp;c.
  They grow only in situations where the soil is sandy or gravelly, or
  on the sides of hills in the crevices of rocks.</p>

  <p><b>Cultivation.</b>&mdash;The growing and resting seasons for
  Echinopsis are the same as for Echinocactus, and we may therefore
  refer to what is said under that genus for general hints with regard
  to the cultivation of Echinopsis in this country. The following is
  from the notes of the late Curator of the Royal Gardens, Kew (Mr. J.
  Smith), as being worthy the attention of Cactus growers. Writing
  about <i>Echinopsis cristata</i>, which he grew and flowered
  exceptionally well, he says: "This showy plant is a native of Chili,
  and, like its Mexican allies, thrives if potted in light loam, with a
  little leaf mould and a few nodules of lime rubbish. The latter are
  for the purpose of keeping the soil open; it is also necessary that
  the soil should be well drained. In winter, water must be given very
  sparingly, and the atmosphere of the house should be dry; the
  temperature need not exceed 50 degs. during the night, and in very
  cold weather it may be allowed to fall 10 degs. lower, provided a
  higher temperature (55 degs.) be maintained during the day. As the
  season advances, the plants should receive the full influence of the
  increasing warmth of the sun; and during hot weather, they will be
  benefited by frequent syringing overhead, which should be done in the
  evening. It is, however, necessary to guard against the soil becoming
  saturated, for the soft fibrous roots suffer if they continue in a
  wet state for any length of time."</p>

  <p>None of the species require to be grafted to grow freely and
  remain healthy, as the stems are all robust enough and of sufficient
  size to take care of themselves. The only danger is in keeping the
  plants too moist in winter, for although a little water now and again
  keeps the stems fresh and green, it deprives them of that rest which
  is essential to the development of their large, beautiful flowers in
  summer.</p>

  <h3>SPECIES.</h3>

  <p><b><a name="ecamp" id="ecamp">E. campylacantha</a>.</b>
  (curved-spined); Bot. Mag. 4567.&mdash;Stem 1 ft. or l&frac12; ft.
  high, globe-shaped, with a somewhat pointed top, the sides divided
  into from fourteen to sixteen ridges, with tubercled edges, bearing
  clusters of about ten strong brown spines, which are stellately
  arranged, a central one projecting outwards, then suddenly curving
  upwards, and measuring 3 in. in length. The flowers are developed
  from the ridges on the side of the stem; they are 6 in. long, the
  tube shaped like a trumpet, brownish in colour, and clothed with
  tufts of short black hairs; petals arranged in three rows, spreading
  so as to form a limb 2&frac12; in. across, pale rose-coloured, with a
  large cluster of yellow-tipped stamens, forming a disk-like centre.
  This species is a native of Chili, and was introduced in 1831. It
  blossoms in spring and summer. The long curving central spine and
  remarkable length of the flower-tube distinguish it from the other
  kinds. It may be grown in a cool greenhouse, where it will thrive, if
  kept freely watered during summer and rested on a dry, sunny shelf in
  winter. It is rare in English collections, but frequently occurs in
  Continental gardens.</p>

  <p><b><a name="ecrist" id="ecrist">E. cristata</a></b> (crested);
  Bot. Mag. 4687.&mdash;Stem globe-shaped, 1 ft. high, slightly
  narrowed towards the top; ridges fifteen, 1 in. deep, sharply
  angular, the edges bearing tufts of spreading, yellowish spines, over
  1 in. long, slightly curved, and tipped with red. Flowers
  creamy-white, springing from the ridges on the top of the stem; tube
  4 in. long, clothed with tufts of black hairs, and surmounted by a
  whorl of reddish-yellow sepals, above which are two rows of
  broad-spreading petals. The width of the flower is over 6 in., and
  the stamens are arranged in a corona-like whorl inside the petals.
  This very fine Cactus is a native of Bolivia, whence it was
  introduced in 1850. When in flower, the broad, long-tubed,
  pale-coloured blossoms equal in beauty those of the Night-flowering
  Cereus. It blossoms in July. It thrives if kept in a warm, sunny
  greenhouse, but must be liberally treated in summer, so as to induce
  vigorous growth, and then be subjected to complete rest in winter in
  full sunlight, or it will not flower.</p>

  <p><b><a name="ecrispu" id="ecrispu">E. c. purpurea</a></b> (purple
  ).&mdash;This variety differs from the type in having deep
  rose-coloured flowers and a slightly longer tube. It is impossible to
  find among all the species of the Cereus section a more beautiful
  plant than this; the size of the flowers, their rich colour, their
  developing three or four together in the month of July, being almost
  exceptional, even among Cactuses. A splendid example of it was
  flowered at Kew in 1846 for the first time. It thrives under the
  conditions recommended for <i>E. cristata.</i> This variety is often
  made very sickly by treating it as a tropical Cactus, and, like most
  of these plants, if once it gets into a bad condition, it remains so
  a long time, in spite of liberal and careful treatment. So many of
  the Cactuses found in cool regions are ruined by an excess of heat in
  winter, and a close atmosphere during their season of growth, that
  too much attention cannot be given to the question of temperature in
  relation to their cultivation in English gardens.</p>

  <p><b><a name="edeca" id="edeca">E. Decaisneanus</a></b>
  (Decaisne's).&mdash;As represented in Fig. 50, this plant appears to
  have a columnar stem, but this is owing to the specimen having been
  formed by cutting off the upper portion of an old plant and striking
  it. Naturally, the stem in this species is globular or slightly
  egg-shaped, and bears about fourteen ridges, upon which are tufts of
  short spines, springing from little cushions of whitish wool. The
  position of the flowers is shown in the figure. The tube is covered
  with tufts of hair-like spines, and the petals and sepals are broad,
  spreading, and white, tinged with yellow, as in <i>E. cristata.</i>
  The native country of this plant is not known; but it is a well-known
  garden Cactus, and thrives in a warm, airy greenhouse in summer, and
  on a dry, sunny shelf in winter. The swollen base of the tube is a
  good example of the nature of what is usually termed the flower-stalk
  in these plants. It is, as has been pointed out, the elongated calyx,
  and the swollen portion is the ovary or seed vessel. If, therefore,
  seeds are desired, the withering flowers should be allowed to remain,
  and, in time, the upper portion of the tube will fall away, leaving
  the base, which continues to grow till it attains the proportions of
  a hen's egg.</p>

  <p><b><a name="eeyri" id="eeyri">E. Eyriesii</a></b>
  (Eyries').&mdash;Stem no larger than an orange, with about a dozen
  ridges, the edges sharp, and bearing little globular tufts of whitish
  wool and red, hair-like spines. Flower exceedingly large for the size
  of the stem, the tube being more than 6 in. long, funnel-shaped, pale
  green, with tufts of brown hairs, which look very much like insects,
  scattered over the surface. The petals are numerous, narrow-pointed,
  spreading, pure white, the stamens pale yellow, and the star-like
  stigma white. This species is a native of Mexico, and was introduced
  by the late Sir John Lubbock, about 1830. It blossoms at various
  seasons, generally in summer. "Independently of the large size of the
  flowers, which rival in dimensions those of the Cereuses, it is
  remarkable for the rich, delicate odour they exhale at night, at
  which time its glorious blossoms expand. When young, they resemble
  long, sooty-grey horns, covered over with a thick, shaggy hairiness,
  and would never be suspected to conceal a form of the utmost beauty
  and a clear and delicate complexion. When the hour of perfection has
  arrived, and the coarse veil of hair begins to be withdrawn by the
  expansion of the unfolding petals, one is amazed at the unexpected
  loveliness which stands revealed in the form of this vegetable star,
  whose rays are of the softest white" (Lindley). For its cultivation,
  this plant requires a warm house always; but care should be taken to
  give it plenty of fresh air and as much light as possible. The soil
  best suited for it is a rich loam with a little sand and charcoal. It
  likes liberal watering in summer.</p>

  This variety differs from the type in the absence of the dark brown
  hairs from the flower-tube, which is also shorter than in <i>E.
  Eyriesii.</i> Probably a native of Mexico.</p>

  <p><b><a name="eoxyg" id="eoxyg">E. oxygonus</a></b>
  (sharp-angled).&mdash;This is very similar to <i>E. Eyriesii</i>.
  Stem globular in shape, and divided into about fourteen acute-edged
  ridges, upon which are tufts of brown spines, varying from &frac12;
  in. to 1&frac12; in. in length. Flower 8 in. long, the tube slightly
  curved, covered with little scales and hairs, and coloured green and
  red. The petals form an incurved cup, and are broad, with pointed
  tips; their colour a bright rose, with a lighter shade towards the
  centre of the flower. As in <i>E. Eyriesii</i>, the flowers of this
  kind are borne several together from the ridges near the growing
  centre of the stem. It is a native of Brazil, whence it was
  introduced nearly half a century ago. It thrives in an intermediate
  house, if treated as advised for <i>E. Eyriesii</i>, and its flowers
  will develop in summer. The extraordinary size and beauty of the
  blossoms are sufficient to compensate for their comparatively short
  duration after expanding; it is also interesting to watch the gradual
  development of the tiny, hairy cone, which is the first sign of the
  flower, and which increases in length and size at a surprising
  rate.</p>

  <p><b><a name="epent" id="epent">E. Pentlandi</a></b> (Pentland's);
  Fig. 52.&mdash;A pretty little species, with a globose stem 3 in. in
  diameter, divided into about a dozen rounded ridges, which are
  undulated or broken up into irregular tubercles, when the ridges do
  not run parallel with each other. Each tubercle is crowned with a
  tuft of brown, bristle-like spines, &frac12; in. or so long. The
  flowers are large in proportion to the size of the plant, the tube
  being 4 in. long, and trumpet-shaped; petals arranged in several
  overlapping rows and forming a cup 2 in. across, the lowest whorl
  turning downwards; in colour, they are a brilliant red, the stamens
  white, and the stigmas yellow. Three or four flowers are often
  expanded together on the same stem, springing from the side instead
  of the top of the plant. Native of Mexico (?); introduced about 1840.
  There are several distinct seedling or hybrid forms of this species,
  remarkable in having the colour of their flowers either red, yellow
  and white, or white, whilst some, such as the one known as
  <i>flammea</i>, have flowers only 2 in. long. These kinds may all be
  grown in a sunny greenhouse or window, as they only require
  protection from frost. They may be placed out of doors in summer, and
  be kept under glass only during winter, treatment which will result
  in better growth and more flowers than if the plants were kept
  permanently under glass.</p>

  ridges, along which are tufts of blackish spines, &frac12; in. long,
  and set in little cushions of white wool. The flower springs from the
  side of the stems, where it replaces a tuft of spines, and, as in
  <i>E. Eyriesii</i>, the tube is remarkably long, whilst the size of
  the whole flower much exceeds that of the rest of the plant, the
  length of the tube being about 6 in., and the width of the flower

  <h3>THE GENUS MELOCACTUS.</h3>

  <h5>(From <i>melon</i>, a melon, and <i>Kaktos</i>, a name applied by
  Theophrastus to a spiny plant; the species are melon-formed, and
  their angles are beset with tufts of spines.)</h5>

  <div class="figleft">
    <img src="images/fancy_T.jpg" width="50" height="118" alt="T" />
  </div><br />

  <p>HIS genus forms a group of well-marked and curious plants, with
  stems similar to those of the globose Echinocactuses and floral
  characters quite distinct from all other genera. They cannot be said
  to possess any particular beauty, as their stems are stiff and dumpy,
  their spines large and rigid, and their flowers small and
  unattractive. But what is wanting in beauty of form or colour is
  atoned for in the cap which crowns the stem, and forms the
  flower-head, growing taller and taller whilst the stem remains
  stationary, till, under favourable circumstances, a cylindrical mass
  of spines and hairs, not unlike a large bottle-brush, and 1 ft. or
  more in length, is developed before the whole plant succumbs to old
  age. This character belongs more particularly to <i>M. communis</i>,
  the commonest species, and the one best known in English gardens.
  Additional interest attaches to this species, from the fact of its
  having been the first Cactus introduced into Europe, for we are
  informed that in the year 1581 living plants of the Melon Cactus were
  known in London. Fifty years later, Gerard, the Adam of English
  gardening, wrote: "Who can but marvel at the care and singular
  workmanship shown in this Thistle, the <i>Melocarduus echinatus</i>,
  or Hedgehog Thistle? It groweth upon the cliffes and gravelly grounds
  neere unto the seaside in the islands of the West Indies, called St.
  Margaret's and St. John's Isle, neere unto Puerto Rico, and other
  places in these countries, by the relation of divers that have
  journied into these parts who have brought me the plant itself with
  his seed, the which would not grow ill my garden, by reason of the
  coldnesse of the clymate." After this, the plant appears to have been
  frequently cultivated in gardens in this country, and it has only
  been in recent years that this and similar curiosities have almost
  disappeared from all except botanical collections.</p>

  <p>The most prominent distinctive characters of Melocactus reside in
  the cap or cluster of spines, wool, and flowers on the summit of the
  stem. Thirty species are included in the genus, their stems ranging
  from 1 ft. to 3 ft. in height, the ridges straight, and, as a rule,
  large; whilst all have stiff stout spines in clusters about 1 in.
  apart. The small flowers are succeeded by bright red, cherry- like
  berries, containing numerous black, shining seeds. The distribution
  of the species is over the hottest parts of some of the West Indian
  Islands and a few places in Central and South America.</p>

  <p><b>Cultivation.</b>&mdash;The cultivation of the several kinds
  known in gardens is as follows: A tropical temperature all the year
  round, with as much sunlight as possible, and a moist atmosphere for
  about three months during summer, when growth is most active. Very
  little soil is required, as the largest stems have comparatively few
  roots; indeed, imported stems have been known to live, and even make
  growth, nearly two years without pushing a single root; but, of
  course, this was abnormal, and was no other than the using-up of the
  nourishment stored up in the stem before it was removed from its
  native home. M. Louis de Smet, a well-known Ghent nurseryman, who
  grows a fine collection of Cactuses, stated that he had kept <i>M.
  communis</i> a long time in robust health and growth by feeding it
  with a very weak solution of salt. Tried at Kew, this treatment did
  not appear to make any perceptible difference; but, bearing in mind
  that the Turk's-Cap Cactus is found in great abundance within the
  reach of sea spray, in some of the West Indian Islands, there seems
  much reason in M. de Smet's treatment. The same gentleman informed us
  that he had a specimen of this Cactus bearing no less than thirteen
  heads. There is, at the time of writing, a specimen at Kew bearing
  four fine heads. Large imported plants are very rarely, established;
  and even when established, they do not thrive long, owing to the fact
  that, after the cap has commenced to form, no further stem-growth is
  made. Young plants grow very slowly, a plant 3 ft. across taking,
  according to Sir W. Hooker, from 200 to 300 years to reach that size.
  It has been stated that grafting is a good plan to adopt for the
  Melocactus, Mr. F. T. Palmer, in "Culture des Cact&eacute;es",
  recommending the following treatment for <i>M. communis</i>: Take a
  <i>Cereus peruvianus</i> of about the same diameter as that of the
  base of the Melocactus, cut off the head of the former, but not so
  low as to come upon the hard, ligneous axis, and then pare off the
  hard epidermis and ribs for about 1 in. Then take off a slice from
  the base of the Melocactus, also paring off about 1 in. of the
  epidermis all round; place the two together, and bind on firmly with
  strong worsted. In warm weather, a union should take place in about
  two months, but it will be safest to allow the ligature to remain
  till growth commences. The precaution of paring off the hard skin and
  ribs is absolutely necessary, as the juicy centre contracts, and the
  rind, or epidermis, does not. There would, therefore, be a cavity
  formed sufficient to prevent all cohesion, be the graft tied on ever
  so tightly.</p>

  <p>Large imported stems should be kept perfectly dry for about a
  fortnight, and, if they show any signs of rottenness, they should be
  carefully examined and the bad portions cut away; exposure to the air
  for a few days will generally cause these pared places to callus
  over. At all times, even when the stems appear to be in good health,
  a sharp look-out should be kept for patches of rottenness in the
  stem, and especially about its base.</p>

  <p><b>Propagation.</b>&mdash;This is effected by means of seeds,
  which usually follow quickly after the flowers produced on cultivated
  specimens. Multiplication is also possible by means of offsets, which
  are formed about the base of the stem if the top of a growing plant
  is cut out. The thirteen-headed plant mentioned above was the result
  of the removal of the top of a stem which had developed these lateral
  growths, and thus formed a family of red-capped stems; this had,
  however, taken place before the plant was removed from its native
  home. As the cap is the most remarkable part of <i>M. communis</i>,
  the purchase of large imported stems, in preference to young ones
  raised from seeds, is recommended; for, as the cap does not form till
  the stem attains a large size, there would be small hope of seedlings
  reaching the flowering stage during a lifetime.</p>

  <h3>SPECIES.</h3>

  <p><b><a name="mcomm" id="mcomm">M. communis</a></b> (common); Fig.
  54.&mdash;Stem from 2 ft. to 3 ft. in diameter, globose, with from
  twelve to twenty ridges, and armed with numerous clusters of strong,
  short spines, the clusters placed closely together. On the summit of
  the stem is a cylindrical crown, about 4 in. broad, and varying in
  height from 5 in. to 12 in. This cylinder is composed of a thick pad
  of whitish, cotton-like substance, through and beyond which a great
  number of bristle-like red spines are developed, the whole being not
  unlike a bottle-brush. About the top of this brush-like growth the
  flowers are produced. These are small, red, fleshy, and tube-shaped,
  the calyx and corolla forming a regular flower, as in a Hyacinth.
  They are borne at various times in the year, as long as the cap is
  growing; afterwards the latter falls off; and the stem rots. We have
  a cap that was cast by an old plant, and which has stood as an
  ornament on a shelf in a room for about four years, and is still in
  perfect condition. In addition to the name of Turk's-Cap Cactus this
  plant is also known as "Englishman's Head" and "Pope's Head." It is a
  native of several of the islands of the West Indies, being very
  abundant in St. Kitt's Island, where it grows in very dry, barren
  places, often on bare porous rocks.</p>

  Bot. Mag. 3691.&mdash;Stem broader than high, deeply cut into about
  ten broad furrows, along the sharp angles of which are clusters of
  pale brown spines, from &frac12; in. to 1 in. long, arranged in a
  star, each cluster 1 in. apart. Instead of the cylinder-like cap of
  the Turk's-Cap species, this one has a short, broad tuft of white
  wool and red spines, like a skull-cap. The flowers are small, and
  soon wither, but remain attached to the oblong berries, which stand
  erect in a dense cluster in the centre of the cap, and are of a
  delicate rose-colour. The first introduced plant of this was sent
  home by Mr. Gardner, who introduced the Epiphyllums and other
  Cactuses. It flowered on the way to England, and matured its seeds
  soon after its arrival. It is a native of Pernambuco.</p>

  <p><b><a name="mmiqu" id="mmiqu">M. Miquelii</a></b> (Miquel's); Fig.

  two plants of it were sent from the West Indian Island, St. Croix, to
  the Hamburg Botanic Gardens. The stem is oval, dark green, with
  fourteen well-defined ribs, as regular as if they had been carved
  with a knife. The spine-tufts are small; spines short, black-brown,
  about nine in each tuft, one of which is central, the others
  radiating; they are less than &frac12; in. long. The "cap" is
  cylindrical, 3 in. high by 4 in. in diameter, and composed of layers
  of snow-white threads, mixed with short reddish bristles.</p>

  <h3>THE GENUS PILOCEREUS.</h3>

  <h5>(From <i>pilos</i>, wool, and <i>Cereus</i>, in allusion to the
  long hairs on the spine cushions, and the affinity of the
  genus.)</h5>

  <div class="figleft">
    <img src="images/fancy_O.jpg" width="53" height="113" alt="O" />
  </div><br />

  <p>NE of the most striking plants in this order is the "Old Man
  Cactus," botanically known as <i>Pilocereus senilis</i>, which is the
  only member of this <i>&nbsp;</i>genus that has become at all known
  in English gardens. In Continental gardens, however, more than a
  dozen species are to be found in collections of succulent plants; and
  of these one of the most remarkable is that represented at Fig. 56.
  The limits of the genus Pilocereus are not definitely fixed,
  different botanists holding different views with respect to the
  generic characters. Recent writers, and among them the late Mr.
  Bentham, sunk the genus under Cereus; but there are sufficiently good
  characters to justify us in retaining, for garden purposes, the name
  Pilocereus for the several distinct plants mentioned here. The
  botanist who founded the genus gives the following general
  description of its members: Stems tall, erect, thick, simple or
  branched, fleshy, ridged; the ridges regular, slightly tubercled, and
  placed closely together. Tubercles generally hairy, with bunches of
  short spines; the hairs long and white, especially about the apex of
  the stem, where they form a dense mass. Flowers on the extreme top of
  the matured stems, and arranged in a cluster as in the Melon Cactus,
  small, tubular; the petals united at the base, and the stamens
  attached to the whole face of the tube thus formed, expanding only at
  night, and fading in a few hours. These flowers have a disagreeable
  odour, not unlike that of boiled cabbage. Fruit fleshy, round,
  persistent, usually red when ripe. The species are natives of
  tropical America, and are generally found in rocky gorges or the
  steep declivities of mountainous regions.</p>

  <p><b>Cultivation.</b>&mdash;These plants require distinctly tropical
  treatment. During summer, they must have all the sunlight possible,
  and be supplied with plenty of water, both at the root and by means
  of the syringe. Air should be given on very hot days, but the plants
  should be encouraged to make all the growth possible before the
  approach of winter. In winter, they may be kept quite dry, and the
  temperature of the house where they stand should be maintained at
  about 60 degs., rising to 65 degs. or 70 degs. in the day. In March,
  the plants should be repotted into as small pots as convenient,
  employing a good, loamy soil and ample drainage. Should the hairs
  become soiled or dusty, the stems may be laid on their sides and then
  syringed with a mixture of soft soap and warm water, to be followed
  by a few syringefuls of pure water; this should cleanse the hairs and
  give them the white appearance to which the plants owe their
  attractiveness.</p>

  <h3>SPECIES.</h3>

  <p><b><a name="phoul" id="phoul">P. Houlletianus</a></b> (Houllet's);
  Fig. 56.&mdash;Stem robust, glaucous-green; ridges about eight,
  broad, prominent, obscurely tubercled; spines in bundles of nine,
  radiating, straight, less than 1 in. long, and pale yellow. Upon the
  growing part of the stem, the spines are intermingled with long,
  white, cottony hairs, often matted together like an unkempt head;
  these hairs fall off as the stem matures. Flowers funnel-shaped,
  resembling Canterbury Bells, borne in a cluster on the summit of the
  plant; ovary short and scaly; petals joined at the base, and coloured
  a rosy-purple, dashed with yellow; the stamens fill the whole of the
  flower-tube and are white; style a little longer than the
  flower-tube, and bearing a ray of about a dozen stigmas. Fruit
  globose, as large as a plum, and coloured cherry-red. The pulp is
  bright, crimson, and contains a few brownish seeds. In the engraving
  the fruit is shown on the left, and a flower-bud on the right. This
  species is often known in Continental collections as <i>P.

  <p><b><a name="pseni" id="pseni">P. senilis</a></b>
  (Old-Man).&mdash;Stem attaining a height of 25 ft., with a diameter
  of about 1 ft.; ridges from twenty-five to thirty on plants 4 ft.
  high; the furrows mere slits, whilst the tufts of thin, straight
  spines, 1 in. long, which crown each of the many tubercles into which
  the ridges are divided, give young stems a brushy appearance. About
  the upper portion of the stem, and especially upon the extreme top,
  are numerous white, wiry hairs, 6 in. or more long, and gathered
  sometimes into locks. To this character, the plant owes it name
  Old-Man Cactus; but, by a curious inversion of what obtains in the
  human kind, old plants are less conspicuous by their white hairs than
  the younger ones. Some years ago, there were three fine stems of this
  Cactus among the cultivated plants at Kew, the highest of which
  measured 18&frac12; ft. There was also, however, a fine specimen in
  the Oxford Botanic Gardens, with a stem 16 ft. high; and it is stated
  that this plant has been in cultivation in England a hundred years at
  least. A plant twenty-five years old is very small, and, from its
  slowness of growth, as well as from the reports of the inhabitants of
  Mexico, where this species is found wild, there is reason to believe
  that a stem 20 ft. high would be several hundred years old. The
  flowers of <i>P. senilis</i> are not known in English collections,
  the plant being grown only for its shaggy hairiness.</p>

  <h3>THE GENUS MAMILLARIA.</h3>

  <h5>(From <i>mamilla</i>, a little teat; in allusion to the
  tubercles.)</h5>

  <div class="figleft">
    <img src="images/fancy_S.jpg" width="56" height="118" alt="S" />
  </div><br />

  <p>OMETHING over 300 different kinds of Mamillaria are known, but
  only a small proportion of these may be considered as garden plants.
  They are characterised generally by short, symmetrically-formed
  stems, sometimes aggregated together and forming a dense tuft, but,
  as a rule, each plant has only one stem. The generic name is
  descriptive of the chief feature in these stems, namely, the
  closely-set, spirally-arranged tubercles or mamillae, which vary
  considerably in the different kinds, but are always present in some
  form or other. Some kinds have stems only 1 in. high by 2/3 in. in
  diameter, and the tubercles hidden from view by the star-shaped
  cushions of reddish or white spines. In some, the spines are erect
  and hair-like, giving the plant the appearance of tiny sea-urchins;
  another group has the principal spines hooked at the tip, and the
  points in these so sharp that if the hand comes in contact with them
  they hook into it and stick like fish-hooks. The purpose of these
  hooked spines seems doubtful; certainly, they cannot serve as any
  protection to the plant itself, as they are so strong that the plant
  must be torn up by the roots before the hooks will give way.</p>

  <p>The spines in <i>M. macromeris</i> are straight, and measure 2 in.
  in length; in <i>M. multiceps</i> they are in two series, the one
  fine, white, and short, the other yellow and stout. The most marked
  section of this genus, however, is that represented by <i>M.
  fissurata</i> (Fig. 61), in which the tubercles are large, spreading
  horizontally, and angular, resembling most closely the foliage and
  habit of some of the Haworthias. No one who had not read up the
  botany of Mamillarias would suspect that this plant belonged to them,
  or even to the Cactus order at all. There is a good specimen of it in
  the Kew collection. When in flower the family resemblance is easily
  seen; but as this species does not flower freely, it will be known by
  its remarkable foliage-like tubercles, rather than as a flowering
  Cactus. And the same remark applies to many of the Mamillarias; their
  stems thickly beset with tubercles and spines, always regular in
  arrangement, and neat and attractive in appearance.</p>

  <p>The following remarks made by Dr. Lindley when describing <i>M.
  tenuis</i>, give a good idea of the singular, yet pretty, stems of
  some of these plants: "Gentle reader, hast thou never seen in a
  display of fireworks a crowd of wheels all in motion at once,
  crossing and intersecting each other in every direction; and canst
  thou fancy those wheels arrested in their motion by some magic
  power&mdash;their rays retained, but their fires extinguished and
  their brightness gone? Then mayst thou conceive the curious beauty of
  this little herb&mdash;a plant so unlike all others that we would
  fain believe it the reanimated spirit of a race that flourished in
  former ages, with those hideous monsters whose bones alone remain to
  tell the history of their existence." It is quite true that in the
  cultivated Mamillarias there is nothing unsightly, or rough, or
  unfinished. Without foliage, their stems globose, or short cylinders,
  or arranged in little cushion-like tufts, and enveloped in silky
  spines, like tiny red stars, always looking the same, except when in
  flower, and never looking in the least like ordinary plants.
  Characters such as these ought to find many admirers. In the
  Succulent House at Kew, there is a long shelf upon which a great many
  plants of this genus may be seen. But the flowers in some of the
  species of Mamillaria are quite as attractive as the stems. Those of
  <i>M. macromeris</i> are 3 in. long and wide, their colour a deep
  rose; <i>M. Scheerii</i> has equally large flowers, and coloured
  bright yellow, as also are the flowers of <i>M. pectinata</i>. This
  last is remarkable on account of the clock-like regularity with which
  its flowers expand. While fresh, they open every day between eleven
  and twelve o'clock, and close again about one, however strong the
  sunlight shining upon them may be. Some of the kinds (more especially
  the small-flowered ones) are often prettily studded over with bright
  red, coral-like berries, which are the little fruits, and contain, as
  a rule, matured seeds capable of reproducing the parent plant.</p>

  <p>The headquarters of the genus Mamillaria is Mexico, and the
  countries immediately to the north, a few being scattered over the
  West Indies, Bolivia, Brazil, and Chili. Many of them grow on
  mountains where the temperature is moderate, but where the sunlight
  is always intense. Others are found on limestone or gravelly hills,
  among short herbage, or on grassy prairies. A small silvery-spined
  kind has recently been found near the snow line in Chili. <i>M.
  vivipara</i> is quite hardy in New York, as also are several other
  kinds, whilst we learn that by planting them out in summer, and
  protecting them by means of a frame from heavy rain, dews, fogs, and
  sudden changes of weather, a good many species of both Mamillaria and
  Echinocactus are successfully managed in the neighbourhood of that
  town.</p>

  <p><b>Cultivation.</b>&mdash;Particulars with respect to cultivation
  are given along with the descriptions of most of the species, but a
  few general principles may here be noted. With only a few exceptions,
  all the cultivated Mamillarias may be grown in a warm, sunny
  greenhouse, or they may be placed in a frame with a south aspect,
  during our summer, removing them into artificially heated quarters
  for the winter. They do not like a large body of soil about their
  roots, but always thrive best when in comparatively small pots. If a
  sweet, new, fibry loam, mixed with broken bricks or cinders, be used
  to pot these plants in, they may then be left undisturbed at the root
  for several years. Much harm is often done to the more delicate kinds
  of Cactuses by repotting them annually; the best-managed collection I
  have seen had not been repotted for four years. This would not be
  safe if a poor and exhausted soil were used in the first instance.
  The pots should be well drained with crocks, and these covered with a
  layer of fibre sifted from loam. In summer, the soil should be kept
  moist, but never saturated; and after a bright warm day, the stems
  may be moistened over by syringing them with tepid water. A point of
  much importance in connection with these, and indeed all tropical and
  extra-tropical plants, is, that the water used for watering or
  syringing them should be rain-water if possible, and never more than
  a degree or so colder than the plants themselves would be. Thus, a
  plant which had been standing in the full glare of a midsummer sun
  all day, would be much endangered by watering it with cold tap-water.
  Where proper arrangements for water are not made in a greenhouse or
  stove, it is a good plan to place the water wanted for the day's use
  in the sun along with the plants. A little bag filled with soot and
  tightly tied at the neck, and water, is a good method for rendering
  hard tap-water suitable for watering the roots of plants. In winter,
  Mamillarias may be kept quite dry at the roots, except in mild sunny
  weather, when a little water may be given.</p>

  <p>A collection of the most distinct kinds may be successfully
  managed in a glass case in a room window, providing the sun shines
  through it for a few hours in the day.</p>

  <p><b>Propagation.</b>&mdash;This is usually effected by means of
  seeds, which may be procured from Continental seedsmen as well as
  from our own. The treatment required by the seeds is similar to what
  has been already advised for those of other Cactuses. The tufted
  kinds are easily multiplied by separating the stems, or even by
  cutting off the tops and planting them in small pots of sandy
  soil.</p>

  <h3>SPECIES.</h3>The following kinds are selected from those known to
  be in cultivation; of course, it is out of the question here to
  enumerate all the species known.

  <p><b><a name="mangu" id="mangu">M. angularis</a></b>
  (angular-tubercled).&mdash;A robust kind, with stems 4 in. to 8 in.
  high, and branching somewhat freely; tubercles prism-shaped, rather
  thick at the base, and slightly angular, &frac14; in. long, their
  tops tufted with short white spines; at the base of the tubercles are
  little tufts of white wool. Flowers are only rarely produced by
  cultivated plants; they are small, tubular, rosy-purple, the stamens
  yellow. Introduced from Mexico in 1835; flowers in summer. When
  happily situated, it forms a specimen 1 ft. in diameter, owing to its
  freely produced arm-like branches, which spread out and curve
  upwards. It requires a warm greenhouse temperature during winter, and
  exposure to bright sunshine at all times.</p>

  <p><b><a name="mappl" id="mappl">M. applanata</a></b> (flattened).
  &mdash;In this, the stem is broader than high, and has a squat
  appearance; tubercles &frac34; in. long, cone-shaped, with stellate
  tufts of straight, hair-like spines, white when young, yellowish when
  aged. Flowers springing from the outside of the stem-top, white,
  tinged with red. It is a native of Mexico, and blossoms in summer. A
  specimen, 6 in. through at the base, may be seen at Kew, where it has
  been for many years, without altering perceptibly in size. All the
  larger-stemmed Mamillarias are exceedingly slow growers after they
  have reached a certain size, although, in the seedling stage, they
  grow freely. The treatment for this kind should resemble that advised
  for the last.</p>

  <p><b><a name="matra" id="matra">M. atrata</a></b>
  (blackened).&mdash;Stem oval in shape, broad at the base, 4 in. high,
  unbranched; tubercles swollen, &frac12; in. long, deep green,
  cone-shaped, becoming flattened through pressure of growth. Spines
  set in a tuft of white hairs, falling off from the lowest mammae, as
  happens in many of the thick-stemmed kinds. Flowers numerous, and
  developed all round the outside of the stem, stalkless, nestling
  closely between the tubercles, and when expanded looking like starry
  buttons of a rosy-pink colour. Native of Chili, flowering in autumn.
  This species is rare in England, but is worth attention because of
  the prettiness of its flowers, the attractive form of its stem, and
  its reputed hardiness. It will thrive in a cold frame, and requires
  protection from excessive wet only, rather than from cold. Grown in a
  warm house, it becomes sickly, and is short-lived.</p>

  <p><b><a name="mbico" id="mbico">M. bicolor</a></b> (two-coloured).
  &mdash;One of the commonest of the Cactuses grown in English gardens,
  and one of the most distinct, owing to its short, silvery hair-like
  spines, thickly crowded on the ends of the small tubercles,
  completely hiding the stem from view. The latter is from 6 in. to 1
  ft. high, 3 in. in diameter, cylindrical, often branching into
  several thick arms, when it has a quaint appearance. If kept free
  from dust, which may be done by covering the plant with a bell glass,
  there is much beauty in the stem; indeed, it is owing to this, rather
  than as a flowering Cactus, that this species finds favour as a
  garden plant. The flowers are less than 1 in. in length and width,
  stellate, their colour deep purple; they are developed in June.
  Although a native of elevated regions in Mexico (4000-5000 ft.), this
  plant thrives best when grown in a warm house. There are several
  handsome and very old specimens of it in the tropical collection of
  succulents at Kew. It is one of the easiest to manage, and will
  thrive in a warm room-window if exposed to bright sunlight and kept
  dry in winter. <i>M. nivea</i> and <i>M. nobilis</i> are both
  varieties of this species.</p>

  <p><b><a name="mchlo" id="mchlo">M. chlorantha</a></b>
  (greenish-yellow).&mdash;A newly-introduced species with erect,
  cylinder-shaped stems, 6 in. high, clothed with numerous tubercles,
  which are tipped with clusters of long, silvery, interlacing,
  hair-like spines, and a few stouter blackish ones. The flowers are
  described as greenish-yellow, so that they are not likely to add much
  to the beauty of the plant, which is recommended because of the
  attractiveness of its stem and spines. It is a native of Mexico and
  Texas, whence it was introduced some two years ago. It requires
  cool-house treatment, and should be kept free from dust, which
  disfigures the white spines.</p>

  <p><b><a name="mcirr" id="mcirr">M. cirrhifera</a></b>
  (twisted).&mdash;Like <i>M. bicolor</i>, this species owes its
  frequent occurrence in gardens to the symmetry and neatly-chiselled
  form of its stems, and not to any attraction possessed by its
  flowers. It will thrive anywhere where the sun can shine upon it, if
  sheltered from severe cold and wet. In a cottage window it may be
  grown, and kept for many years, without losing health or, on the
  other hand, increasing much in size. Its usual height is about 5 in.,
  by 4 in. in diameter. The tubercles are angular at the base, and bear
  tufts of yellowish spines on their pointed apices. The flowers are
  small, and bright rose-coloured, but only rarely produced on
  cultivated plants. Introduced from Mexico in 1835.</p>

  <p><b><a name="mclav" id="mclav">M. clava</a></b> (club-shaped); Bot.
  Mag. 4358.&mdash;In the size of its stem, and the large,
  brightly-coloured flowers it bears, this species may be compared with
  some of the Echinocactuses. The stem is from 1 ft. to 1&frac12; ft.
  high, 4 in. wide at the base, narrowing slightly upwards; the
  tubercles are 1 in. long, and nearly as much through at the base,
  their shape that of little pyramids, and their tips bear each from
  eight to eleven stout, straight spines, pale brown, with a little
  wool at the base. The flowers are borne on the top of the stem, two
  or three of them together; the sepals are green and red, and the
  spreading petals are straw-coloured and glossy, their edges near the
  top being toothed. In the centre of the shallow cup formed by the
  petals, and which measures nearly 4 in. across, the orange-coloured
  stamens are clustered, in a kind of disk, through the middle of which
  the yellow stigma projects. It is a native of Mexico, at an altitude
  of 5000 ft. Introduced in 1848, when it flowered at Kew, in June, at
  which time it flowers almost every year now. A warm greenhouse
  affords the most suitable conditions for it; but, unless it is kept
  in full sunshine both summer and winter, and perfectly dry during the
  latter season, it will not produce any flowers. As a flowering plant,
  it ranks amongst the very best of the Mamillarias. It is easily
  propagated from seeds ripened on cultivated plants.</p>

  <p><b><a name="mdasy" id="mdasy">M. dasyacantha</a></b>
  (thick-spined).&mdash;Stem 2 in. to 3 in. high, almost globular, and
  covered with spiral whorls of tiny tubercles, in the grooves of which
  is a little whitish wool, which falls away as the tubercles ripen.
  The spines upon the tubercles are arranged in little stars, with an
  erect central one. The flowers are small, and spring from the centre
  of the stem. This is one of the Thimble Cactuses, and is too small to
  have any great attractions, either in stem or flowers. It is,
  however, a pretty plant, especially when studded with its ruby-like
  flowers, which look like coloured Daisies growing upon a dense tuft
  of hairs. It is a native of Mexico, where it grows on high mountains
  among short grass and other herbage.</p>

  <p><b><a name="mdisc" id="mdisc">M. discolor</a></b> (spines
  two-coloured).&mdash;Stem globose, about 4 in. in diameter; tubercles
  smooth, egg-shaped, their bases embedded in white wool, their tips
  crowned with stellate tufts of short, reddish spines. Flowers
  numerous, and borne from almost all parts of the stem, less than 1
  in. wide, and composed of a single whorl of narrow, reflexed,
  rose-purple petals, surrounding a large, disk-like cluster of yellow
  stamens. The flowers are so short that they are half hidden by the
  tubercles. It is a native of Mexico, where it grows on rocks, in
  warm, sheltered places. Under cultivation it thrives when grown on a
  dry shelf in a warm house, and kept moist in summer, but perfectly
  dry in winter.</p>

  <p><b><a name="mdoli" id="mdoli">M. dolichocentra</a></b>
  (long-spurred); Fig. 58.&mdash;Apparently this is a variable species;
  at all events, plants of widely different habit are found under this
  name, one of them represented in the Figure here, another in the
  <i>Garden,</i> Vol. XVII., whilst others are figured or described in
  other books. What is known at Kew as the true plant is that here
  figured. This has a stout stem, about 8 in. high and 3 in. wide, and
  covered with smooth cone-shaped mammae, with woolly bases and
  stellate tufts of spines on their tips. The flowers are produced
  about 1 in. from the top of the stem, and are less than 1 in. wide;
  they are, however, often very numerous, sometimes a closely-set ring
  of them surrounding the stem, like a daisy chain, their colour being
  pale purple. Below the flowers there is often a whorl of club-shaped
  fruits, &frac34; in. long, and rose-coloured. These contain numerous
  little black seeds, which, when ripe, may be sown in pots of very
  sandy loam. The plant is a native of Mexico, and flowers in summer.
  It thrives in a tropical temperature, and enjoys a daily syringing
  overhead on bright days in summer, but in winter requires little or
  no water.</p>

    <p>FIG. 58.&mdash;MAMILLARIA DOLICHOCENTRA</p>
  </div>

  <p><b><a name="mechi" id="mechi">M. echinata</a></b>
  (hedgehog-like).&mdash;A charming little plant, with very small
  stems, clustered together in a cushion-like tuft, each stem less than
  1 in. wide; but a well-grown specimen is composed of dozens of these,
  packed almost one on top of the other. The tubercles are hidden by
  the star-like spine clusters which cap them, and look like a swarm of
  insects. Flowers very small, rose-coloured, and lasting only about a
  day. These are succeeded by numerous currant-like red berries, so
  numerous, in fact, that the plants look as if thickly studded all
  over with coral beads. The central stem is sometimes about 6 in.
  high, those surrounding it being shorter and shorter, till the
  outside ones rise only just above the soil. A well-grown plant of
  this is strikingly pretty, even when not in fruit. It is a native of
  Mexico, and requires the treatment of a warm house. A few pieces of
  broken brick should be placed upon the surface of the soil about the
  base of the plant, as the stems like to press against, or grow upon,
  anything in the nature of rocky ground.</p>

  <p><b><a name="mechin" id="mechin">M. echinus</a></b>
  (hedgehog-like); Fig. 59.&mdash;A distinct and pretty little plant,
  the largest specimen having a stem about the size and shape of a
  small hen's-egg, completely hidden under the densely interwoven
  radial spines, which crown the thirteen spiral rows of tubercles, and
  are almost white when mature. The tubercles are &frac12; in. long,
  and, in addition to these white radiating spines, they also bear each
  a stout spike-like spine, growing from the centre of the others. This
  spine gives the plant an appearance quite distinct from all other
  cultivated Mamillarias. The flowers are produced two or three
  together, on the top of the stem, and they are nearly 2 in. long,
  cup-shaped, and coloured yellow; they usually appear about June. As
  yet this species is rare in cultivated collections. It comes from
  Mexico, where it is found growing on limestone hills, in hot and arid
  localities. Under cultivation it requires a warm greenhouse
  temperature, exposure to bright sunshine all the year round, with a
  moderate supply of water in summer, and none at all during winter. A
  few large pieces of broken brick or sandstone placed in the soil,
  just under the base of the stem, afford the roots conditions suitable
  to their healthy growth.</p>

  </div>

  <p><b><a name="meleg" id="meleg">M. elegans</a></b>
  (elegant).&mdash;A small species, grown only for the prettiness of
  its stem, flowers rarely, if ever, being borne by it under
  cultivation. The stem is 2 in. high and wide, globose, with small
  conical tubercles, which, when young, are woolly at the tips. Spines
  short and slender, about twenty, arranged in a star on each tubercle,
  with four central ones a little longer than those which surround
  them; the colour of the spines is whitish, with brown tips. Native
  country Mexico, on high exposed hills; in this country it requires
  greenhouse treatment. Introduced about 1850.</p>

  <p><b><a name="melep" id="melep">M. elephantidens</a></b>
  (elephant's-tooth); Fig. 60.&mdash;One of the largest and most
  remarkable of all garden Mamillarias. Stem globose, depressed, 6 in.
  to 8 in. in diameter, and bright shining green. Tubercles smooth,
  round, 1&frac12; in. long, furrowed across the top, which is at first
  filled with wool, but when old is naked. At the base of the tubercles
  there is a dense tuft of white wool, and springing from the furrows
  are eight radiating recurved spines, and three short central ones,
  all strong, stiff, and ivory-white, tipped with brown. The flowers
  are 3 in. wide, and are composed of a circle of violet-coloured
  sepals, with white margins, and a second circle of petals which are
  bright rose, pale purple at the base, a line of the same colour
  extending all down the middle. The stamens are numerous, with long
  purple filaments and yellow anthers, and the pistil is stout, erect,
  projecting above the stamens, with a radiating stigma. Flowers in
  autumn; native country, Paraguay. Under cultivation, it grows quicker
  than is usual with plants of this genus, and it is also exceptional
  in the regular and abundant production of its flowers. It has been a
  rarity in European collections for many years, and, although easily
  grown, it is often killed through wrong treatment. A cool greenhouse
  or sunny frame in summer, plenty of water whilst growth is active,
  and a light, well-drained soil, suit it best; whilst during winter it
  must be kept perfectly dry, and protected only from frost. In a
  tropical house, it is invariably sickly, and altogether
  unsatisfactory.</p>

  </div>

  <p><b><a name="melon" id="melon">M. elongata</a></b>
  (elongated).&mdash;A small, cushion-like kind, with the stems in
  tufts, owing to their producing offsets freely from the base, the
  tallest of them being about as high and as thick as a man's thumb.
  The tubercles are short, crowded, and hidden under the star-clusters
  of reddish-yellow spines. There are no central spines in this kind.
  The flowers are produced in the axils of the tubercles from all parts
  of the stem, a large tuft of stems being thickly studded with circles
  of tawny yellow petals, which are only about &frac12; in. long. The
  berries are bright coral-red, and about the size of a date stone.
  There are several varieties of this species, under the names of
  <i>intertexta, rufescens, rutila, subcrocea</i>, and
  <i>supertexta.</i> These differ only slightly either in the length or
  thickness of the stems or in the colour of the spines. All of them
  may be grown in a cold frame, or in a window where the sun can shine
  upon them; or they may be grown along with tropical kinds. For small
  cases in windows, these little Thimble Cactuses are amongst the most
  suitable. They are natives of high mountains in Mexico, and have been
  cultivated in Europe over forty years.</p>

  <p><b><a name="mfiss" id="mfiss">M. fissurata</a></b> (fissured);
  Fig. 61.&mdash;In appearance, this rare species mimics some of the
  Gasterias, and is so different from all the kinds hitherto described,
  that very few people unacquainted with it would suspect that it
  belonged to the same genus as <i>M. elongata</i> or <i>M.
  dolichocentra</i>. Indeed, some botanists have made a separate genus
  of this and several other plants of the same peculiar appearance,
  calling them <i>Anhalonium. M. fissurata</i> is like a whip-top in
  shape, the root being thick and woody, and the tubercles arranged in
  a thick layer, spreading from the centre, rosette-like. A living
  plant in the Kew collection is 2 in. high by 4 in. wide, the
  tubercles being triangular in shape, &frac12; in. thick, wrinkled,
  with an irregular furrow on the upper surface. The flowers grow from
  the middle of the stem, and are 1&frac12; in. wide, and
  rose-coloured. Native of Mexico, on hard gravel or limestone soils.
  We know of no plant in English collections, except that at Kew, which
  was introduced from Mexico in 1886. It flowers in September and
  October.</p>

  </div>

  <p><b><a name="mflor" id="mflor">M. floribunda</a></b>
  (free-flowering).&mdash;A French writer on Cactuses, M. Labouret,
  calls this a species of Echinocactus, but it resembles so closely
  another species included by him in Mamillaria, viz., <i>M.
  atrata</i>, that we see no good reason for separating the two into
  different genera. <i>M. floribunda</i> has an irregular conical stem,
  about 5 in. high by 4 in. wide at the base, round nut-like tubercles
  the size of filberts, crowned with star-tufts of spines &frac34; in.
  long, stiff, and brown, about ten spines being set with their bases
  in a small disc-like pad of dirty-white wool. The flowers are very
  numerous, covering the whole of the stem-top, from which they stand
  erect, so as to form a dense bouquet of rose-coloured petals. Each
  flower is 2 in. long. Native of Chili; introduced about 1835. Flowers
  in summer. This handsome kind will thrive in a window, and, if well
  supplied with fresh air, sunshine, and sufficient water to keep the
  soil moist, it will flower almost every year. It must have no water
  in winter.</p>

  <p><b><a name="mgrac" id="mgrac">M. gracilis</a></b>
  (slender).&mdash;A small Thimble Cactus, remarkable for its
  proliferous stems, a single stem 2 in. high producing all round its
  upper half numerous, offshoots, which fall to the ground and grow. In
  this way a tuft of stems is soon developed round the first one. If
  these offshoots are removed as they appear, the stem will grow longer
  and stouter than it does when they are left. Tubercles small, green,
  crowded; spines in a stellate tuft, short, curved, pale yellow or
  white. Flowers as in <i>M. elongata</i>, to which this species is
  closely allied. In window cases, or on a shelf in a cool greenhouse,
  it will grow and multiply rapidly. Like the bulk of the caespitose,
  or Thimble Cactuses, it does not make much show when in flower; and
  it is only its stems, with their white stars of spines and clusters
  of little offsets hanging about them, that are attractive. Native of
  Mexico; introduced about 1850. There is a variety known as
  <i>pulchella</i>, in which the spines are of a yellow hue.</p>

  <p><b><a name="mgrah" id="mgrah">M. Grahami</a></b>
  (Graham's).&mdash;A pretty little species, with globose stems,
  scarcely 3 in. high, and nearly the same in diameter, branching
  sometimes when old; tubercles &frac14; in. long, egg-shaped, corky
  when old, and persistent. Spines in tufts of about twenty, all
  radiating except one in the centre, which is hooked; they are about
  &frac12; in. long. Flowers 1 in. long, usually produced in a circle
  round the stem. Fruit a small, oval berry, &frac12; in. long. This is
  a native of Colorado, in mountainous regions. It is very rare in
  cultivation. The flowers are developed in June and July.</p>

  <p><b><a name="mhaag" id="mhaag">M. Haageana</a></b> (Haage's); Fig.
  62.&mdash;The habit of this is shown in the Figure, which is reduced
  to about one-fourth the natural size. As the stem gets older, it
  becomes more elongated. Tubercles small, four-sided at the base,
  pointed at the top, where the spines are arranged in a star, about
  twenty of them on each tubercle, with two central ones, which are
  longer, stiffer, and much darker in colour than those on the outside;
  flowers small, almost hidden beneath the spines, bright carmine-rose;
  they are produced on the sides of the upper portion of the stem in
  June. There is a close resemblance between this and <i>M.
  cirrhifera</i>, and the treatment for both should be the same.

  <p><b><a name="mlong" id="mlong">M. longimamma</a></b>
  (long-tubercled); Fig. 63.&mdash;A well-marked species in the size of
  its mammae, or tubercles, which are at least 1 in. long by 1/3 in. in
  diameter, terete, slightly curved, and narrowed to a pointed apex,
  the texture being very soft and watery. Each tubercle bears a
  radiating tuft of about twelve spines, one central and projecting
  outwards; they are pale brown when old, and white when young; their
  length is about &frac12; in. A tuft of short, white wool is developed
  at the base of the spines on the young mammae. The stem is seldom
  more than 4 in. in height, and it branches at the base when old.
  Flowers large and handsome, citron-yellow; the tube short, and hidden
  in the mammae; the petals 1&frac12; in. long, narrow, pointed, and
  all directed upwards; stamens numerous, short. Flowering season,
  early summer. Native country, Mexico. It requires greenhouse
  treatment, or it may be placed in a sunny frame out of doors during
  summer. It is not easily multiplied from seeds, but is free in the
  production of offsets from the base of the stem.</p>

  daisy; stamens numerous, short, forming a disk; colour carmine,
  almost purple just before fading. Flowering season, August. Native of
  Mexico, where it is found in loose, sand on hillocks, generally about
  the roots of Acacias. It is one of the most beautiful of all
  Mamillarias; but it is, as yet, rare in collections. It requires the
  same treatment as <i>M. longimamma</i>, except that, owing to the
  woody nature of its rootstock, and its long, tap-like roots, it

  <p><b><a name="mmacrot" id="mmacrot">M. macrothele</a></b>
  (large-nippled); Bot. Mag. 3634, as <i>M. Lehmanni</i>.&mdash;This
  belongs to the same group as <i>M. cirrhifera</i>, but is
  distinguished by its large mammae, which are four-angled at the base,
  &frac34; in. long, narrowed to a point, upon which is a tuft of wool
  and a cluster of about eight spines, &frac12; in. long, spreading,
  reddish-brown in colour, the central one being almost black, 1 in.
  long, and pointing downwards. In the axils of the mammae are tufts of
  white wool. Flowers on the top of the stern, erect, spreading, about
  1&frac12; in. across when expanded; the petals overlapping, and pale
  yellow; the stamens red at the base, arranged in a dense cluster, and
  the rays of the stigma spreading over them. Flowering time, early
  summer. Native country, Mexico, on prairie lands, at high elevations.
  This species is almost hardy in the warmer parts of this country,
  suffering from damp rather than frost in winter. The stem is not
  particularly handsome, but the flowers are large and bright, and they
  are produced annually by plants which are grown in a cool, well-aired
  greenhouse or frame, with the sun shining on them all day.</p>

  <p><b><a name="mmicr" id="mmicr">M. micromeris</a></b>
  (small-flowered); Fig. 65.&mdash;A small, cushion-like plant, with a
  stem never more than 1&frac12; in. across by about 1 in. in height,
  so that it has the appearance of a small, flattened ball, with a
  raised, disk-like portion on the top. The mammae are very small, and
  they are completely hidden by the numerous fine, white, silky spines
  and wool which spring in tufts from the apex of each mamma, and
  interlace so as to form a spider-web-like net all over the stem. The
  flowers are small, and they spring from the centre of the disk-like
  top of the stern; they are composed of from three to five sepals, and
  five petals, which are whitish or pink, and measure about &frac14;
  in. across when open. Native country, Mexico, where it is found only
  in naked places on mountain tops or sides where limestone is
  plentiful. It requires much care under cultivation, water in excess
  being fatal to it, and a soil of the wrong sort soon killing all its
  roots. It is cultivated at Kew in a small pot, in a mixture of loam
  and lime rubbish, and grown in a warm greenhouse.</p>

  together, and they each bear a tuft of whitish wool, with a radiating
  cluster of spines, which are soft, almost hair-like in texture, the
  inner ones being stiffer, and coloured dull yellow. The flowers are
  small, and almost hidden by the spines and tubercles; they are pale
  yellow, with a line of red down the middle of each petal. Native
  country, Mexico. This plant should be grown on a shelf in a cool

  rows, swollen at the base, and bearing each a star-like tuft of about
  twenty-four stiff, brown, radial spines, without a central one; the
  length varies from &frac12; in. to 1 in., and they are comb-like in
  their regular arrangement. When not in flower, this species bears a
  close resemblance to small plants of <i>Cereus pectinatus</i>.
  Flowers terminal, solitary, large, their width quite 3 in. when fully
  expanded; sepals reddish-green; petals rich sulphur-yellow; filaments
  reddish, very numerous; the flowers open at noon, and close after
  about two hours, even although the sun be shining full upon them.
  Flowering season, June to August. Native country, Mexico, on slopes
  of limestone hills. Although long since known to botanists, this
  pretty species has only lately found its way into English gardens. It
  is attractive even when not in flower. It requires warm greenhouse
  treatment, with exposure to full sunshine; during late autumn it
  should have plenty of air to ripen the new growth made whilst
  flowering. In winter it should have a dry position near the

  all points except the seed, which, as is denoted by the name, is half
  enveloped in a corky covering, suggesting acorns. Stems simple,
  sometimes proliferous at the base, globose when young, afterwards
  almost cylinder or pear-shaped, 5 in. high, 2 in. in diameter;
  tubercles &frac12; in. long, arranged in twelve spiral rows, slightly
  woolly in axils. Spines radiating, in two rows, about fifty on each
  tubercle, the three or four central ones being hooked at the tips or
  sometimes straight; length, &frac12; in. to 1&frac12; in. Flowers
  (only seen in the dried state) 1 in. long and wide. Native of the dry
  gravelly hills and sand ridges in California and Colorado, and,
  therefore, requiring greenhouse treatment. This plant is cultivated
  in the Kew collection, but it has not been known to flower there. It
  is one of the most ornamental of the very spinous species, the radial
  spines being almost white, whilst the central ones are black, and
  look like tiny fish-hooks. A large proportion of these Mamillarias
  are far more interesting in the form and arrangement of their
  tubercles and spines than in any floral character, and it is on this
  account that so many which are insignificant as flowering plants are
  included here.</p>

  <p><b><a name="mpulc" id="mpulc">M. pulchra</a></b>
  (handsome).&mdash;Stem globose when young and cylindrical when old,
  flattened at the top; height from 4 in. to 6 in.; tubercles large,
  egg-shaped, arranged in from eleven to thirteen spiral rows; spines
  in compact tufts, their bases set in whitish wool, irregular in
  length, and almost covering the whole of the stem. Flowers medium in
  size, developed near the top of the stem from the woolly axils of the
  tubercles; colour bright rose. Native of Mexico. Flowering season,
  June. Introduced in 1826. A rare kind nowadays, though one of the
  prettiest. It should always be grown in a warm house. It has been
  also called <i>M. pulcherrima</i>.</p>

  <p><b><a name="mpusi" id="mpusi">M. pusilla</a></b> (small).&mdash;A
  tiny tufted plant, belonging to the group known as Thimble Cactuses.
  It has stems 2 in. high; short, dark green tubercles, with tufts of
  whitish wool in the axils; spines thin and bristle-like, twisted,
  nearly 1 in. long, almost hiding the stem; they are whitish, with
  black tips. The flowers are yellowish-white, with streaks of red.
  Common in Mexico. Flowering season, May. It should be grown in a
  frame in summer, and wintered on a shelf in a warm greenhouse. It
  would, no doubt, thrive in a window if kept in a sunny position and
  placed under a glass shade. A variety known as <i>texana</i> differs
  in being more densely clothed with spines. We have seen it grown into
  large clumps, covering a space 1 ft. in diameter, with dozens of
  erect little pyramids of whitish spines.</p>

  <p><b><a name="mpycn" id="mpycn">M. pycnacantha</a></b> (densely
  spined); Bot. Mag. 3972.&mdash;The name for this kind is rather
  misleading, the spines being both fewer and less conspicuous than in
  many other species of Mamillaria. Stem about 6 in. high, nearly
  globose; tubercles&mdash;rather large, swollen, with tufts of short
  white wool in their axils, and stellate clusters of spines springing
  from disks of white wool on the top. The spines are &frac12; in.
  long, slightly recurved, flattened, and pale brown. Flowers large,
  clustered on the top of the stem, about half a dozen opening
  together; width 2 in.; petals numerous, narrow, toothed at the tips,
  spreading; colour a deep sulphur-yellow, anthers orange. Native of
  Oaxaca, Mexico. Flowering season, July. Introduced 1840. This is a
  beautiful flowering plant, more like an Echinocactus than a
  Mamillaria. It should be grown in a warm greenhouse all the year
  round. Old stems develop offsets from the base, by which the species
  may be multiplied.</p>

  <p><b><a name="msang" id="msang">M. sanguinea</a></b> (bloody); Fig.
  68.&mdash;This is closely related to <i>M. bicolor,</i> but differs
  in having an unbranched stem and numerous richly-coloured flowers.
  The stem is stout, 6 in. high, and 4 in. through; tubercles crowded,
  short, bearing stellate tufts of shortish spines, and projecting
  longer ones, all being bristly and pale yellow, except those on the
  youngest tubercles, which are golden. The flowers are borne in a
  crowded circle on the top of the stem, just outside the cluster of
  young yellow spines, a strong plant having about forty flowers open
  together. Each flower is about &frac12; in. long and wide, and
  coloured bright crimson, with yellow anthers. Native of Mexico.
  Flowers in June. It should be grown along with <i>M. bicolor</i>. The
  plant figured is a young one, showing the spines much longer than is
  usual on mature specimens.</p>

  tubercles large, swollen, somewhat flattened, pale green, watery,
  woolly in the axils, the tops crowned with about a dozen brown
  spines, 1 in. long, one central, the others radial. Flowers terminal,
  erect, with several whorls of spreading, recurved petals, the lower
  ones tinged with crimson, the upper pale yellow, and forming a
  shallow cup, 2 in. across; anthers forming a compact sheaf in the
  centre. Flowers in summer. This distinct and very pretty species was
  introduced many years ago from Mexico, where it was discovered in
  1845 by a Mr. Potts, to whose love for these plants we are indebted
  for a great many choice kinds collected and sent to England by him.
  It grows naturally in a red, sandy loam, and under cultivation

  which grow into full-sized stems, and develop young ones, till a
  compact cushion is formed. Tubercles closely arranged, cylindrical,
  shining green, with fifteen to twenty radial, white, hair-like
  spines, &frac12; in. long, and three inner ones, which are thicker,
  purplish in colour, usually only one being hooked. Flowers white,
  with a line of rose down the middle of each petal, &frac34; in.

  &mdash;Stem globose, 3 in. to 5 in. high, thickly clothed with long,
  narrow, pointed tubercles, the bases of which are set in white wool,
  whilst the apices are crowned with tiny stars of white silky spines;
  more like the pappus of a Composite than the spines usually found on
  Cactuses. A healthy plant has a very pretty and silky appearance
  which cannot well be described. The flowers are small and
  unattractive; they are succeeded by the red fruits, which remain on
  the plant a long time, and add to its beauty. Native country, Mexico.
  Introduced 1838. Should be grown in a greenhouse where frost is
  excluded, and where there is plenty of sunlight at all times. It is

  cushion of white wool, their tips bearing tiny tufts of wool, and
  four small spines, which fall away on the tubercles becoming ripe,
  leaving two short, diverging, central spines. Flowers small, not
  ornamental, and scantily developed near the outside of the top.

  when very old, when it becomes proliferous at the base; tubercles
  crowded, small, arranged spirally, and crowned with clusters of long,
  radiating spines, which are almost white, hair-like, and become
  thickly interwoven, as in the Old Man Cactus <i>(Pilocereus
  senilis</i>). The central spine is black, and hooked at the tip.
  Flowers on the top of the stem, near the centre; the petals toothed,
  spreading, and forming a deep cup, with a cluster of tall stamens
  standing erect in the middle; colour bright scarlet. The flowers,
  which appear in summer, remain open about eight hours. Native country
  unknown; cultivated in France in 1845. This plant is difficult to
  preserve in health, the best method being that of grafting it on to a
  short Cereus, or a robust kind of Mamillaria, such as <i>M.
  cirrhifera</i>. It is a pretty plant at all times, even when dead,
  for we have seen plants of it preserve the appearance of live
  specimens long after they have rotted and dried up in the centre,
  nothing remaining but the shell formed by the skin and silvery
  spines. There is a close resemblance between this species and <i>M.
  Grahami</i>.</p>

  <p><b><a name="mstel" id="mstel">M. stella-aurata</a></b> (golden
  star).&mdash;This little plant obtains its name from the rich
  golden-yellow of its stellate clusters of spines, which are arranged
  thickly on the tips of the small, pointed tubercles. It belongs to
  the group called Thimble Cactuses, of which it is one of the
  prettiest. The stems are tufted, branching freely at the base, and
  rising to a height of about 2 in. Flowers small, whitish, and much
  less ornamental than the berry-like fruits which succeed them, and
  which are egg-shaped, &frac12; in. long, and a deep rose-colour.
  <i>M. tenuis</i> is a variety of this, with almost white spines.
  Native of Mexico. Introduced 1835. May be cultivated under a

  of white wool in the corners at the base, and crowned with tufts of
  from four to seven spines, usually all radial, sometimes one central.
  The flowers, which usually appear in May, are arranged in a zone on
  the top of the old stems; sepals greenish-yellow, petals bright red.
  Fruit 1 in. long, pear-shaped, scarlet. Native of South Mexico, at
  high elevations. It may be grown outside in summer, and wintered in a
  heated greenhouse or frame. This is a singular-looking plant, the

  the base by globose branches or offsets. The tubercles are closely
  set in numerous spiral rows, and are &frac12; in. long, rather
  narrow, pointed, with a crown of radial spines, very slender,
  hair-like, white, and &frac12; in. long; central spines three or
  four, &frac12; in. long. At the base of each tubercle is a pea-like
  tuft of white wool. In this kind the spines fall from the old
  tubercles, which are persistent, gradually hardening to a cork-like
  substance. The flowers are produced in the apex of the stem, and are
  1 in. long and wide, daisy-like, pale purple in colour; they are
  succeeded by red, oval berries, which are as pretty as the flowers.
  About five flowers are developed on each stem annually&mdash;May and

  length, and coloured red. Flowers terminal, just peeping above the
  tubercles; sepals and petals acute, yellow, &frac34; in. long;
  anthers yellow; stigma white. An old garden plant, introduced from
  Mexico. It flowers in May and June. For its cultivation it may be
  treated as recommended for <i>M. pusilla</i>.</p>

  <p><b><a name="mvill" id="mvill">M. villifera</a></b>
  (hair-bearing).&mdash;Stem similar to the last, but usually
  proliferous at the base; tubercles angular, short, woolly in the
  axils, and bearing four rigid, short, reddish-brown spines on the
  apex. Flowers pale rose, with a line of purple down the middle of
  each petal; they are developed near the top of the stem, in May.
  Native country, Mexico. This plant thrives if treated as recommended
  for <i>M. pusilla</i>. There are several varieties known,
  distinguished by their paler or darker flowers, or by a difference in
  the length and arrangement of the spines.</p>

  <p><b><a name="mviri" id="mviri">M. viridis</a></b>
  (green).&mdash;Stem 4 in. high by 3 in. in diameter, proliferous at
  the base; tubercles short, four-angled, crowded in spiral rows,
  woolly at the base, bearing each five or six radiating hair-like
  spines on the apex, and one central erect one, none more than
  &frac14; in. long. Flowers erect, on top of stem, with recurved, pale
  yellow petals, 1 in., long; they are produced in May and June.
  Introduced from Mexico in 1850. It may be grown in a sunny frame out
  of doors during summer, and on a dry, warm greenhouse shelf in
  winter.</p>

  <p><b><a name="mvivi" id="mvivi">M. vivipara</a></b>
  (stem&mdash;sprouting).&mdash;A tufted, free-growing Thimble Cactus,
  producing its small stems in such profusion as to form a cluster as
  much as 3 ft. in diameter. The small tubercles are hidden by the
  numerous radial spines, which are in clusters of about twenty; they
  are white, hair-like, stiff and &frac12; in. long; the central
  spines, numbering from four to six, are a little longer. Flowers from
  apex of stem, 1&frac12; in. long and wide, and composed of about
  thirty fimbriated sepals and twenty-five to forty narrow petals;
  colour bright purple. Fruit &frac12; in. long, pale green when ripe.
  The flowers, which appear in May and June, usually expand after
  mid-day. Native of Louisiana. In the North-West plains and Rocky
  Mountains of North America this plant is abundant, often forming wide
  cushion-like tufts, which, when covered with numerous purple,
  star-like flowers, have a pretty effect. In Utah and New York it is
  commonly cultivated as a hardy garden plant, bearing exposure to keen
  frosts and snow without suffering; but it would not thrive out of
  doors in winter with us, unless covered by a handlight during severe
  weather, and protected from heavy rains in winter. It likes a strong,
  clayey soil.</p>

  <p><b><a name="mwild" id="mwild">M. Wildiana</a></b>
  (Wild's).&mdash;An old garden Cactus, and one of the prettiest of the
  tufted, small-stemmed kinds. Its largest stems are 3 in. high by
  about 1&frac12; in. in diameter, and bear spiral rows of clavate,
  dark green, crystallised tubercles, &frac12; in. long, with about ten
  radial white spines, &frac12; in. long, the three upper spines,
  together with the solitary central hooked one, being yellow. Flowers
  small, numerous on the apices of the stems, rose-coloured, lined with
  purple; they are developed in summer. This also forms dense tufts of
  stems. A specimen at Kew, only a few years old, has already over
  thirty heads. It is a native of Mexico, at an altitude of 5000 ft.,
  growing on lava and basalt, and even on the trunks of trees. For its
  cultivation, a shelf in a sunny greenhouse is a most suitable
  position, both in winter and summer. Introduced 1835.</p>

  <p><b><a name="mwrig" id="mwrig">M. Wrightii</a></b>
  (Wright's).&mdash;This is a charming little plant, of something the
  same character as <i>M. dolichocentra</i>. It has not long been
  cultivated in gardens, but being easy to manage, and exceptionally
  pretty, it is sure to become a favourite as it gets known. Stem
  rounded above, narrowed and peg-top-like at the base, the top
  flattened, about 3 in. across, height about the same. Tubercles
  conical, &frac12; in. long, shining green, and bearing a tuft of six
  or eight spines, which are straight, hair-like, white, and &frac12;
  in. long; there are two central spines, of same length, and hooked.
  Flowers in the top of the stem, 1 in. long and wide, bright purple;
  they are succeeded by egg-shaped, purple berries, 1 in. long, and
  prettily arranged among the tubercles. In England a warm house seems
  most suitable for this species. It likes plenty of moisture and
  sunlight during the summer, whilst making new growth; but in winter,
  when at rest, it ought to be kept on a shelf, and just moistened
  overhead in bright weather. There are healthy examples of it at Kew.
  Flowering season, May and June. Native country, Mexico. Introduced
  about 1878.</p>

  <p><b><a name="mzucc" id="mzucc">M. Zucchariniana</a></b>
  (Zuccharini's).&mdash;Stem simple, globose, often attaining a height
  of 10 in. by about 7 in. in diameter. Tubercles dark green, conical,
  1/3 in. long, &frac12; in. broad at base, naked at the point, but
  with four to six spines springing from the areole a little below the
  point; spines ash-coloured, stiff, black-tipped. Flowers in a ring
  about the top of the stem, length 1 in., the tube enveloped in long,
  black, twisted hairs; sepals brown-purple; petals narrow,
  sharp-pointed, purple-rose coloured; stamens white and yellow; stigma
  rose-coloured. Flowers in June and July. Native of Mexico. A large,
  handsome-stemmed kind, easily kept in health, and flowering freely if
  grown on a shelf in a cool greenhouse in winter, and placed in a
  warm, sunny position out of doors in summer. It produces seeds
  freely, and pretty plants, 3 in. or more in diameter, may be obtained
  in two years from seeds. By grafting it, when young, on the stem of a
  Cereus or cylindrical Opuntia, a healthy, drumstick-like plant is
  easily obtained.</p>

  <h3>THE GENUS LEUCHTENBERGIA.</h3>

  <h5>(Named in honour of Prince Leuchtenberg.)</h5>

  <div class="figleft">
    <img src="images/fancy_A.gif" width="54" height="113" alt="A" />
  </div><br />

  <p>MONG the many instances of plant mimicry that occur in the Cactus
  order, the most remarkable is the plant here figured. Remove the
  flower from Leuchtenbergia, and very few people indeed would think of
  calling it a Cactus, but would probably consider it a short-leaved
  Yucca. In habit, in form, in leaf, and in texture, it more resembles
  a Yucca or an Agave than anything else, and when first introduced it
  was considered such by the Kew authorities until it flowered. The
  leaves, or rather tubercles, are sometimes longer and slenderer than
  in Fig. 74. The nearest approach to this plant is <i>Mamillaria
  longimamma</i>, in which the tubercles are 1 in. or more long,
  finger-shaped, and crowned with a few hair-like spines. But the
  Leuchtenbergia bears its flowers on the ends of the tubercles, and
  not from the axils, as in all others. This peculiarity leads one to
  infer that tubercles are modified branches, the spines representing
  the leaves. Some species of Mamillaria and Echinocactus develop young
  plants from the tops of their tubercles; and this also points to the
  probability that the latter are branches. In Leuchtenbergia, the
  tubercles fall away as the plant increases in height, leaving a bare,
  woody stem similar to that of a Yucca.</p>

  <p><b>Cultivation.</b>&mdash;The Leuchtenbergia has always been
  difficult to keep in health. It thrives best when kept in a warm,
  sunny house during winter, and in an exposed, airy, warm position
  under a frame during summer. It may be watered regularly whilst
  growing&mdash;that is, from April to September&mdash;and kept quite
  dry all winter. The soil should be well-drained loam, and the roots
  should have plenty of room. A specimen may be seen in the Kew
  collection.</p>

  <p><b>Propagation.</b>&mdash;This may be effected from seeds, or by
  removing the head from an old plant, putting the former in sand, and
  placing it under a bell-glass to root, watering it only about once a
  week till roots are formed. The old stem should be kept dry for about
  two months, and then watered and placed in a sunny, moist position,
  where it can be syringed once a day. A shelf in a stove is the best
  position for it. Here it will form young buds in the axils of the
  withered tubercles, and on the edges of the persistent parts of the
  tubercles themselves. They first appear in the form of tiny tufts of
  yellowish down, and gradually develop till the first leaf-like
  tubercle appears. When large enough, the buds may be removed and
  planted in small pots to root. If an old plant is dealt with in this
  way in April, a batch of young ones should be developed and rooted by
  October. Grafting does not appear to have ever been tried for this
  plant. When sick, the plant should be carefully washed, and all
  decayed parts cut away; it may then be planted in very sandy loam,
  and kept under a bell-glass till rooted.</p><a name="leuchp" id=

  </div>

  <h3>SPECIES.</h3>

  <p><b>L. principis</b> (noble); Fig. 74.&mdash;This, the only species
  known, was introduced from Mexico to Kew in 1847, and flowered the
  following year. The plant attains a height of 1 ft. or more, the stem
  being erect, stout, clothed with the persistent, scale-like bases of
  the old, fallen-away tubercles, the bases having dried up and
  tightened round the stem. The upper part is clothed with the curved,
  leaf-like tubercles, from 3 in. to 6 in. long, grey-green in colour,
  succulent, with a tough skin, triangular, and gradually narrowed to a
  blunt point, upon which are half a dozen or more thin, flexuous,
  horny filaments, neither spines nor hairs in appearance, but almost
  hay-like; the central one is about 5 in. long, and the others about
  half that length. The flowers are borne on the ends of the young,
  partly-developed tubercles, near the centre of the head; they are
  erect, tubular, 3 in. to 4 in. long, scaly, gradually widening
  upwards; the sepals and petals are numerous, and form a beautiful
  flower of the ordinary Cactus type, quite 4 in. across, and of a
  rich, clear yellow colour. The anthers, which also are yellow, form a
  column in the centre, through which the nine-rayed stigma protrudes.
  Strong plants sometimes produce two flowers together.</p>

  <h3>THE GENUS PELECYPHORA.</h3>

  <h5>(From <i>pelekyphoros</i>, hatchet-bearing; referring to the
  shape of the tubercles.)</h5>

  <div class="figleft">
    <img src="images/fancy_L.jpg" width="50" height="119" alt="L" />
  </div><br />

  <p>IKE Leuchtenbergia, this genus is monotypic, and it is also rare,
  difficult to cultivate, and exceptionally interesting in structure.
  It is closely related to the Mamillarias, as may be seen, by
  comparing the Figure here given with some of them; indeed, it was
  once known as <i>M. asellifera</i>, having been described under that
  name when first introduced, in 1843. From Mamillaria, however, it
  differs in the form of its tubercles, which are hatchet-shaped, and
  cleft at the apex, where each division is clothed with small, horny,
  overlapping scales, not unlike the back of a woodlouse&mdash;hence
  the specific name.</p>

  <p><b>Cultivation.</b>&mdash;The Hatchet Cactus grows very slowly,
  specimens such as that represented in our Illustration being many
  years old. We have seen healthy plants, freshly imported, grow for a
  few months, and then suddenly die, the inside of the stem rotting
  whilst outside it looked perfectly healthy. It is always grown on its
  own roots, but probably it would thrive better if grafted on the stem
  of some dwarf Cereus or Echinocactus.</p><a name="peleca" id=

    <p>FIG. 75.&mdash;PELECYPHORA ASELLIFORMIS</p>
  </div>

  <p><b>Propagation.</b>&mdash;The propagation of Pelecyphora is
  easiest effected by means of seeds, which, however, are not always
  procurable. It is stated by Labouret, a French writer on Cactuses,
  that the first plants introduced arrived dead, but a few seeds were
  found in a withered fruit on one of the dead stems, and from these
  the first plants grown in Europe were raised. M. de Smet of Ghent,
  had a large stock of this Cactus a few years ago, and a German
  nurseryman, H. Hildmann, of Oranienberg, near Berlin, usually has
  many young plants of it for sale.</p>

  <h3>SPECIES.</h3>

  <p><b>P. aselliformis</b> (woodlouse-like); Fig. 75.&mdash;The size,
  habit, and structure of this plant are so well represented in the
  Figure that little description is necessary. The stems are simple
  till they get about 3 in. high, when they develop offsets about the
  base, which may either be removed to form new plants, or allowed to
  remain and grow into a specimen like that in the Illustration. The
  flowers are large for the size of the plant, and they are developed
  freely in the apex of the stems in the early part of the summer. The
  tube is very short, naked, and completely hidden by the young mammae;
  sepals and petals in four series, the outer one pale purple, the
  inner of a deep purple colour; stamens very numerous, and the stigma
  has only four erect lobes. The plant was first described from
  examples cultivated in Berlin in 1843, but the flowers were not known
  till 1858. There are several varieties known, viz., <i>P. a.
  concolor</i>, which is distinguished by the whole of the flower being
  deep purple in colour; <i>P. a. pectinata</i> has larger scales
  (spine-tufts); and <i>P. a. cristata</i> is, as its name denotes a
  kind of cockscomb or crested form. They are all natives of
  Mexico.</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2>
  <hr />

  <h3>THE GENUS OPUNTIA.</h3>

  <h5>(The old Latin name used by Pliny, and said to have been derived
  from the city of Opus.)</h5>

  <div class="figleft">
    <img src="images/fancy_T.jpg" width="50" height="118" alt="T" />
  </div><br />

  <p>HERE are about 150 species of Opuntia known, all of them natives
  of the American continent and the West Indies, though a considerable
  number have become naturalised in many other parts of the world. They
  are, with very few exceptions, easily distinguished from all other
  Cactuses by the peculiar character of their stems and spines; they
  are also well marked in the structure of their flowers. They vary in
  size from small, trailing, many-branched plants, never exceeding 6
  in. in height, to large shrubs 8 ft. to 30 ft. high. (Humboldt states
  that he saw "Opuntias and other Cactuses 30 ft. to 40 ft. high.")
  Generally the branches are nearly flat when young, and shaped like a
  racquet or battledore; but in some species the branches are round
  <i>(i.e.</i>, in <i>O. cylindrica</i>, <i>O. subulata</i>, <i>O.
  arborescens</i>, &amp;c.). All the kinds have fleshy stems, which
  ultimately become cylindrical and woody. At first they consist of
  fleshy joints, superposed upon one another, the joints varying
  considerably in size and shape. When young they bear small fleshy
  leaves along with the spine-tufts; but the former fall off at an
  early stage, whilst the spines are altered in length or number as the
  joints get old. In one or two kinds the spines fall away when the
  joints begin to harden, and in <i>O. subulata</i> the leaves are
  large and persistent.</p>

  <p>The nature of the spines of Opuntias is of a kind that is not
  likely to be forgotten by anyone coming into contact with them. Every
  spine, from the tiny bristles, hardly perceptible to the naked eye,
  to the stout, needle-like spears which are found on the branches of
  some kinds, is barbed, and they are so very sharp and penetrating
  that even a gentle touch is sufficient to make them pierce the skin.
  Once in they are very difficult to get out; the very fine ones can
  only be shaved level with the skin, and left to grow out, whilst the
  larger must be cut out if they have penetrated to any depth. This
  horrid character in Opuntias, whilst rendering them disagreeable to
  the gardener, has been turned to good account in many of our
  colonies, where they are commonly used as fences. A good hedge of
  such kinds as <i>O. Tuna</i> or <i>O. horrida</i> is absolutely
  impassable to both man and beast, and as the stems are too watery to
  be easily destroyed by fire, their usefulness in this way could not
  be surpassed. As all the Opuntias will grow in the very poorest of
  soils, and even on bare rocks, and as they grow very rapidly, they
  have been largely employed in Africa, Australia, and India for
  fences. It is reported that when an island in the West Indies was
  divided between the French and English, the boundary was marked by
  three rows of <i>O. Tuna</i>.</p>

  <p>The flowers of Opuntias are not, as a rule, particularly
  attractive. In many of the kinds they are large and well-formed, but
  the colours are tawny-yellow, greenish-white, or dull red. These
  plants cannot, therefore, be recommended for any floral beauty,
  although it is probable that the same flowers, on plants of less
  repulsive appearance than Opuntias are, as a rule, would be admired.
  There are a few exceptions to this in such species as <i>O.
  Rafinesquii, O. missouriensis</i>, and <i>O. basilaris</i>, which are
  compact and dwarf, and bear numerous large, brightly-coloured
  flowers. The fruits of Opuntias, or, at least, some of them, are
  edible, and to some palates they are very agreeable. We have tasted
  them, and consider they are mawkish and insipid&mdash;not much better
  than very poor gooseberries. Sir Joseph Hooker has compared them to
  Pumpkins. They are pear-shaped, with a thick, spine-covered rind,
  containing green, yellow, or red pulp, with small, hard seeds
  scattered through it.</p>

  <p>The fruit of Opuntia differs in character and structure from the
  ordinary kind of fruit, such as apples, pears, &amp;c. It consists of
  a branch, or joint, modified in form, and bearing on its flattened
  apex a flower, with the ovary buried in a slight depression in the
  fleshy joint. After becoming fertilised, the ovary grows down into
  the joint, and, ultimately the whole joint is changed into a
  succulent, juicy, often coloured "fruit." That this is the case has
  been proved by planting the unripe "fruit" of Opuntias in pots of
  sandy soil, and treating them as cuttings, when they have developed
  buds at the apex and roots at the base, ultimately forming
  plants.</p>

  <p>The vitality in the branches of most of the species is very great,
  the smallest piece, as a rule, emitting roots and developing into a
  plant in a comparatively short time. The branches are soft, and
  easily broken, so that, in gathering the fruits, many pieces are
  broken off and cast aside; these soon grow into plants, and in a
  short time an extensive "colony" of Opuntias springs up where
  previously only one had been. The seeds, too, are a ready means of
  increase, being distributed by birds and other animals, which eat the
  fruits. In consequence of this free vegetative character, the
  Opuntias introduced into some of our colonies have become a pest
  almost as difficult to deal with as the rabbit scourge in Australia.
  In English gardens, however, there is no danger of Opuntias getting
  the upper hand. The adaptability of the majority of the kinds for
  cultivation under what may be termed adverse conditions for other
  plants, and the ease with which they may be propagated, render the
  management of a collection of these plants an easy matter. Amongst
  other Cactuses, Opuntias have a striking effect, and a selection of
  them should be grown in even the smallest collections. A few of them
  may be recommended specially as attractive plants for a sheltered,
  sunny rockery.</p>

  <p><b>Cultivation.</b>&mdash;The cultural requirements of the
  Opuntias may more conveniently be referred to under the description
  of each kind.</p>

  <p><b>Propagation.</b>&mdash;This entails no exceptional treatment;
  the numerous seeds contained in each fruit germinate freely if sown
  in sandy soil, and placed on a shelf in a warm house; and the
  smallest branches root quickly if planted in pots of open soil and
  kept in the Cactus-house. Large branches root just as freely as small
  ones. At Kew an enormous specimen, which had grown tall, and
  developed a thicket of branches too great for the house where it
  grew, was reduced most summarily by simply cutting off the head of
  branches and planting it in the ground where the original specimen
  had been. In a short time this "cutting" was well rooted, and made
  better growth than it had before the operation was performed.</p>

  <p>As stocks for grafting, many of the more robust kinds of Opuntia
  are well adapted, and very singular-looking specimens may be obtained
  by making the most of this fact. One of the crested or monstrous
  forms, when grafted on a flat-stemmed kind, presents the queerest of
  appearances, looking like a large green cockscomb growing out of the
  top of a bladdery kind of stem. Equally odd combinations may be made
  by grafting a flat-stemmed kind on one whose stem is cylindrical. As
  all the kinds unite with the greatest ease, a taste for oddities
  among plants may easily be gratified by making use of Opuntias in
  this way. The time most favourable for the operation is
  spring&mdash;say, the month of April. For full information on how to
  graft Cactuses, see Chapter IV., on <a href=

  <h3>SPECIES.</h3>

  <p align="left"><b><a name="oarbo" id="oarbo">O. arborescens</a></b>
  (tree-like).&mdash;This species is known as the Walking-Stick or
  Elk-Horn Cactus, from its cylindrical, woody stems being made into
  very curious-looking walking-sticks (examples of which may be seen in
  the Museum at Kew), whilst the arrangement of the branches is
  suggestive of elk horns. Habit erect; joints cylindrical, branching
  freely, and forming trees from 8 ft. to 30 ft. high. Stems covered
  with oblong tubercles and tufts of long, needle-like spines, which
  give the plant a very ferocious aspect. Flowers on the ends of the
  young branches, 2 in. to 3 in. in diameter, bright purple in colour,
  developing in June. It is a native of Mexico, &amp;c., and requires
  greenhouse or stove treatment. The skeletons of this species, as seen
  scattered over the desert places where it is wild, have a very
  singular and startling appearance. They stand in the form of trees,
  quite devoid of leaves, spines, or flesh, and, owing to the peculiar
  arrangement of the ligneous layers, nothing remains except a hollow
  cylinder, perforated with mesh-like holes, indicating the points
  where the tubercles and small branches had been. These skeletons are
  said to stand many years.</p>

  <p><b><a name="oarbu" id="oarbu">O. arbuscula</a></b> (small tree).
  &mdash;Another of the cylindrical kinds, with a solid, woody trunk,
  about 4 in. through, and clothed with smooth, green bark; it grows to
  a height of 7 ft. or 8 ft. Branches very numerous, slender, copiously
  jointed, the ultimate joints about 3 in. long and &frac12; in. thick;
  they are slightly tuberculated, and bear tufts of spines nearly 1 in.
  long. Flowers 1&frac12; in. in diameter, produced in June; petals
  few, greenish-yellow, tinged with red. It is a native of Mexico, and
  requires stove treatment. A pretty plant, or, rather, a very
  remarkable one, even when not in flower, the thin branches, with
  their hundreds of long, whitish spines, being singular.
  Unfortunately, it is not easily grown.</p>

  <p><b><a name="oaren" id="oaren">O. arenaria</a></b> (sand-loving).
  &mdash;Stems spreading, forming a tuft 3 ft. through and about 1 ft.
  high. Joints 1&frac12; in. to 3 in. long, and a little less in width,
  terete, with very prominent tubercles and numerous tawny bristles;
  upper spines 1 in. to 1&frac12; in. long, white, with a yellow point,
  shorter ones hair-like and curled. Flowers 2 in. in diameter,
  produced in May. Fruit 1 in. long, bearing a few short spines.
  Mexico. A strong-rooted plant, which should be grown in very loose,
  sandy soil. It would probably thrive best when planted out on a stage
  near the glass in a stove.</p>

  <p><b><a name="oaube" id="oaube">O. Auberi</a></b>
  (Auber's).&mdash;An erect-growing plant, 8 ft. or more high, not
  unlike <i>O. Ficus-indica</i> in the form of its joints, but with
  long spines springing from the cushions, whereas the latter has none.
  The joints are oblong-ovate, glaucous-green, the cushions few and
  scattered; spines white, flattened, of various lengths. Flowers tawny
  yellow, small for the size of the plant. A native of Cuba, and
  requiring stove treatment. Being very brittle, this plant should be
  supported with stakes.</p>

  <p><b><a name="oaura" id="oaura">O. aurantiaca</a></b>
  (orange).&mdash;A dwarf, cylindrical-stemmed kind, branching freely.
  Joints short, &frac34; in. in diameter; cushions of reddish spines,
  one about 1 in. long, the others shorter; bases of spines enveloped
  in white wool. Flowers bright orange, 2 in. to 3 in. across. This
  species is a native of Chili, whence it was introduced in 1824. It

  sunny position outside during summer.</p>

  <p><b><a name="obasi" id="obasi">O. basilaris</a></b> (branching at
  the base); Fig. 76.&mdash;A dwarf, compact plant, of peculiar habit.
  Stem short, branching into a number of stout, obovate, often
  fan-shaped joints, which usually spring from a common base, and curve
  inwards, suggesting an open cabbage. Joints 5 in. to 8 in. long,
  about 1 in. thick, covered all over with dot-like cushions of very
  short, reddish spines, set in slight depressions or wrinkles. Flowers
  of a beautiful and rich purple colour, about 2&frac12; in. in
  diameter, and produced in May. This distinct plant is a native of
  Mexico, and is of recent introduction. Plants of it may be seen in
  the Kew collection. It is apparently easily kept in health in an
  ordinary stove temperature along with other Cactuses. It varies in
  the form of its joints and in its manner of branching, but it seems
  never to develop the joints one on the top of the other, as do most
  Opuntias. This species is certain to become a favourite when it
  becomes better known.</p>

  <p><b><a name="obige" id="obige">O. Bigelovii</a></b> (Bigelow's).
  &mdash;A cylinder-stemmed, tall-growing plant, with a stout, woody
  stem, bearing a dense head of branches. Joints 2 in. to 6 in. long, 1
  in. to 2 in. in diameter, light green, covered with small tubercles
  and little spine-cushions, with larger spines 1 in. long. When wild,
  the young joints are often shaken off by the wind, and cover the soil
  around, where they take root or stick to the clothes of the
  passers-by like burrs. Flowers not known. A native of Mexico, where
  it forms a tree 12 ft. high; it requires stove treatment. The
  skeleton of the trunk is a hollow cylinder, perforated with numerous
  holes, which occur in a regular spiral. The appearance of a
  full-grown specimen is very striking, the oval joints, thickly
  covered with long, needle-like spines, hanging in clusters, more
  suggestive of spiny fruit than branches.</p>

  <p><b><a name="oboli" id="oboli">O. boliviana</a></b> (Bolivian);
  Fig. 77.&mdash;Stems 1 ft. high, erect, branching, and composed of
  roundish, pale green joints, with small, round tubercles, and long,
  white, flexible spines, sometimes as much as 4 in. in length;
  cushions about 1 in. apart. Flowers 1&frac12; in. across, yellowish.
  This is a fat, gouty-looking plant, from Bolivia, requiring stove
  treatment. It often assumes a yellow hue on the older joints, even
  when in good health.</p>

  <p><b><a name="obrac" id="obrac">O. brachyarthra</a></b>
  (short-jointed); Fig. 78.&mdash;A dwarf-growing, singular-looking
  plant, with short, tumid joints from 1 in. to 2 in. long and wide,
  and nearly the same in thickness. The shortness of the joints,
  together with their growing on the top of each other, has been not
  inaptly compared to a jointed finger. Cushions very close together,
  composed of short, white and yellowish bristles, and stout, terete
  spines, 1 in. or more long, set on little tubercles. Flowers 1 in. in
  diameter, with about five sepals, eight or nine petals, and a
  five-rayed stigma; they are borne on the apices of the topmost
  joints. This species is worth growing on account of its peculiar
  stems and the length of its white spines. It is a native of New
  Mexico, and has been recently introduced to Kew, where it is
  cultivated among the hardy kinds, and also in the greenhouse.</p>

  <p><b><a name="obraz" id="obraz">O. braziliensis</a></b>
  (Brazilian).&mdash;The peculiar habit and mode of growth at once
  distinguish this species. It rises with a perfectly straight, erect,
  slender, but firm and stiff, round stem, to a height of from 10 ft.
  to 30 ft., tapering from the base upwards, and furnished all the way
  up with short, horizontal branches, spreading about 3 ft. all round,
  like an immense candelabrum. Spines long, subulate, very sharp,
  ash-coloured, in clusters. Joints broadly oblong, margins wavy; they
  resemble leaves, or the thin, leaf-like joints of a Phyllocactus,
  with the addition of long, whitish spines on both sides. Flowers
  1&frac12; in. in diameter, lemon-yellow, very freely produced on the
  younger joints during May and June. Fruit as large as a walnut,
  spiny, yellow when ripe. This species is a native of Brazil, whence
  it was introduced in 1816. It may be recommended for large, airy
  houses, as it grows freely, and forms a striking object when arranged
  with foliage and flowering plants of the ordinary kind. Its fruits
  are edible.</p>

  <p><b><a name="ocand" id="ocand">O. candelabriformis</a></b>
  (candelabrum-shaped).&mdash;Stems erect, 5 ft. to 8 ft. high; joints
  flat, almost circular, about 6 in. in diameter, glaucous-green,
  densely clothed with numerous cushions of white, bristle-like spines,
  a few in each cushion being long and thread-like. Flowers not known
  on cultivated plants. This sturdy species is a native of Mexico, and
  succeeds well if planted on a little rockery or raised mound in a
  warm house, where, properly treated, it branches freely, and forms a
  dense mass of circular joints. It is one of the most useful of the
  larger Opuntias for cultivation in large houses.</p>

  <p><b><a name="oclav" id="oclav">O. clavata</a></b> (club-shaped).
  &mdash;Stem short; joints club-shaped, 2 in. long and 1 in. wide,
  narrowed almost to a point at both ends. Cushions &frac14; in. apart,
  composed of numerous spines, varying from short and bristle-like to 1
  in. in length, stout, flattened, and spear-like. Leaves &frac14; in.
  long. Flowers yellow, 1&frac12; in. across. Fruit 1&frac12; in. long,
  lemon-yellow when ripe, and covered with stellate clusters of white,
  bristle-like spines. New Mexico, 1854. A stove species, remarkable
  for the strength and form of its central spines, which are spear or
  dagger-shaped.</p>

  <p><b><a name="ococh" id="ococh">O. cochinellifera</a></b>
  (cochineal-bearing); Bot. Mag. 2742.&mdash;An erect-growing plant,
  attaining a height of 9 ft. or more, and branching freely, the older
  parts of the stem and branches being woody and cylindrical; young
  joints flat, oblong-ovate, varying in length from 4 in. to 1 ft.,
  deep green, rather soft and watery, spineless, the cushions distant,
  and sometimes bearing a few very short bristles. Flowers at the
  extremities of the branches, 1&frac12; in. long, composed of numerous
  imbricating, scale-like petals, curving inwards, and coloured
  crimson. Fruit flat-topped, 2 in. long, red; pulp reddish; seeds
  black. It is a native of tropical South America, whence it was
  introduced in 1688. It requires stove treatment, and blossoms in
  August. This is one of the most useful of the genus, on account of
  its being the kind chiefly employed in the cultivation of cochineal.
  It is one of the easiest to manage, requiring only a rather dry
  atmosphere, plenty of light, and a temperature not lower than 50
  degs. in winter. Syn. <i>Nopalea cochinellifera.</i></p>

  <p><b><a name="ocorr" id="ocorr">O. corrugata</a></b>
  (wrinkled).&mdash;Stem not more than 2 ft. high; joints cylindrical,
  wrinkled all over, about 2 in. long, covered with cushions of white
  hair or bristle-like spines. Flowers 1&frac12; in. across,
  reddish-yellow, produced in August. A native of Chili, whence it was
  introduced in 1824. It may be grown in an ordinary greenhouse, on a
  shelf near the glass, and exposed to full sunshine.</p>

  <p><b><a name="ocura" id="ocura">O. curassavica</a></b> (Curassoa);
  Pin-pillow.&mdash;Branches spreading; joints cylindrical or
  club-shaped, dark green, bearing numerous cushions of woolly
  bristles, and long, white, very sharp-pointed spines. Flowers 3 in.
  across, greenish-yellow, borne on the young joints in June.
  Introduced from Curassoa in 1690. A free-growing plant under
  favourable conditions, and one requiring stove treatment. It has been
  cultivated in gardens almost as long as any species of Cactus. There
  are several varieties of it known, differing from the type in habit,
  length of spine, or shade of colour in the flower.</p>

  <p><b><a name="ocyli" id="ocyli">O. cylindrica</a></b>
  (cylindrical).&mdash;Stem and joints cylindrical, the latter covered
  with spindle-shaped tubercles, each one crowned with a tuft of fine,
  hair-like, whitish spines, one or two in each tuft being stiff, and
  sharp as needles. The leaves are fleshy, cylindrical, 1 in. or more
  long, and they remain on the joints longer than is usual in Opuntias.
  Flowers crowded on the ends of the branches, each 1 in. in diameter,
  scarlet; they are developed in June. This plant is said to grow to a
  height of 6 ft. or more in its native habitat, but under cultivation
  it is rarely seen more than 3 ft. high; it was introduced in 1799. It
  is handsome and distinct enough to be worth growing. It requires
  stove or greenhouse treatment, but rarely flowers under
  cultivation.</p>

  <p><b><a name="ocylic" id="ocylic">O. c. cristata</a></b>
  (crested).&mdash;A dwarf, cockscomb-like variety, with the leaves and
  white hairs growing all along the wrinkled top of the comb. It is a
  very singular example of a "monster" Cactus. It requires stove
  treatment.</p>

  <p><b><a name="odavi" id="odavi">O. Davisii</a></b> (Davis'); Bot.
  Mag. 6652.&mdash;Stems somewhat horizontal, not exceeding 1&frac12;
  ft. in height; joints 4 in. to 6 in. in length, and about &frac12;
  in. in thickness; wood dense, and hard when old; tubercles not
  prominent, bearing cushions of very slender bristles, forming a kind
  of brush, from amongst which the spines spring. The longest spines
  are 1&frac12; in., and they are covered with a loose, glistening
  sheath. Flowers 2 in. in diameter, greenish-brown. The plant is a
  native of New Mexico, and was introduced in 1883. It forms a compact,
  shrubby little plant if grown in an intermediate house during winter,
  and placed in the open in full sunshine during summer. It was
  flowered for the first time in England in 1883, and although not what
  we should call an attractive plant, in America it is described as
  being "a well-marked and pretty species." It is named after Jefferson
  Davis, the American statesman.</p>

  <p><b><a name="odecu" id="odecu">O. decumana</a></b> (great-oblong).
  This is the largest-growing species in cultivation. At Kew it is
  represented by a plant 12 ft. high (it would grow still taller if the
  house were higher). It has a hard, woody, brown-barked stem, bearing
  an enormous head of very large, elliptical, flat joints, 12 in. to 20
  in. long, and about 1 ft. broad, smooth, grey-green, with a few
  scattered cushions of very tiny bristles, and sometimes, though
  rarely, a spine or two. Flowers large, orange-coloured, produced in
  summer. Fruit oval, 4 in. long, spiny, brownish-red, very watery when
  ripe; flesh red, sweet. A native of Brazil, and requiring stove
  treatment. This is said to be what is known in Malta as the Indian
  Fig. The plant is chiefly interesting here on account of the
  extraordinary size of the joints.</p>

  <p><b><a name="odiad" id="odiad">O. diademata</a></b>
  (diademed).&mdash;A small, remarkable, and extremely rare little
  species, with a short, erect stem, composed of globose, superposed
  joints, grey-green in colour, and very succulent. The topmost joint
  is pear-shaped, with a tuft of whitish hair and spines on the apex,
  out of which the new growth pushes. Cushions large, about 1 in.
  apart, furnished with a tuft of short, grey hairs and short spines,
  with a large one at the base. The character of this large spine is
  exceptional, being broad, flat, cartilaginous, whitish, and curving
  downwards. On healthy large examples these spines are 2 in. long, and
  nearly &frac14; in. wide at the base. Flowers and fruit not known.
  Native of Mendoza (La Plata). This little plant requires to be
  cultivated in a warm greenhouse or stove, but it grows very slowly.
  It is certainly a most interesting Cactus; examples of it may be seen
  at Kew, where there is a plant which, although over ten years old, is
  only 4 in. high. Syns. <i>O. platyacantha</i> and <i>Cereus
  syringacanthus</i>.</p>

  <p><b><a name="odill" id="odill">O. Dillenii</a></b> (Dillenius');
  Fig. 79.&mdash;An erect-growing, robust species, attaining a height
  of 15 ft., with flattened, ovate joints, about 5 in. long by 3 in.
  broad. Cushions composed of short, white, hair-like bristles, and
  numerous long, stout, yellow spines. Flowers yellow, tinged with red,
  4 in. in diameter, freely produced on the ends of the youngest joints
  all summer. Fruits similar to those of <i>O. Ficus-indica</i>. A
  native of the West Indies, now naturalised in all warmer parts of the
  world. In India it is so plentiful and widespread that Roxburgh, an
  Indian botanist, said it was a native. In India, its fruits are eaten
  by the poor natives, and it is often planted as a hedge. It is also a
  great pest in the open lands of that country, and large sums are
  annually expended in cutting it down and burying it. This species,
  which requires warm greenhouse treatment, is also employed in the
  cultivation of cochineal.</p>

  long, less than 1 in. thick. Cushions of rather coarse bristles and
  numerous spines, from &frac12; in. to 1 in. in length. Flowers 2 in.

  almost saucer-shaped, and bearing spines nearly 1 in. long. A native
  of Colorado, &amp;c. It requires stove treatment. The variety
  <i>major</i> has stems 4 ft. high, joints 8 in. to 10 in. long, and
  long, sheathed spines. This species is closely related to <i>O.

  cylindrical, curved, 4 in. long, 1&frac12; in. thick. Tubercles very
  prominent, longitudinally attached to the stem, the apices crowned
  with pea-shaped cushions of short bristles, and numerous radiating
  spines, some of which are fully 2 in. long, very strong and
  needle-like. Flowers 2&frac12; in. in diameter, sulphur-yellow,
  tinged with purple, produced in August and September. Fruit 2&frac12;
  in. long and 1 in. thick, covered with cushions of bristles and
  spines. A native of Mexico, on dry, sandy soils, where its prostrate
  stems, clothed with powerful spines, form a hiding-place for the
  small animals, snakes, &amp;c. Stove or warm greenhouse treatment is
  best for this species.</p>

  <p><b><a name="oenge" id="oenge">O. Engelmanni</a></b>

  diameter. Cushions 1&frac12; in. apart, composed of coarse bristles,
  and one or two spines over 1 in. long, and pointing downwards.
  Flowers 3 in. in diameter, yellow, produced in May and June. Fruit
  nearly round, 2 in. long, purplish both in rind and pulp, the latter
  rather nauseous to the taste. Mexico. This is a greenhouse plant
  which grows freely and flowers annually under cultivation. It is very
  similar to <i>O. monacantha</i>, a much better known species.
  According to American botanists, it is probably the most widely
  spread of the whole Cactus tribe.</p>

  <p><b><a name="oficu" id="oficu">O. Ficus-indica</a></b> (Indian
  Fig); Fig. 80.&mdash;Branches erect, 8 ft. to 12 ft. high; joints
  flat, oval or obovate, about 1 ft. long by 3 in. in width, and 1 in.
  in thickness. Stems hard and woody with age. Cushions 1&frac12; in.
  apart, composed of short, yellowish bristles, and very rarely one
  spine. Flowers 3 in. to 4 in. across, sulphur-yellow, produced all
  through the summer. Fruit 3 in. to 4 in. long, pear-shaped, covered
  with tufts of bristles, white, yellow, or red when ripe. It is a
  native of Central America, whence it was introduced about 300 years
  ago. It is now widely spread, in tropical and temperate regions all
  over the world. In many parts it is cultivated for the sake of its
  fruits, which in some of our colonies are used for dessert. In
  England it must be protected from damp and cold; it is, therefore,
  best cultivated in a sunny greenhouse during winter, and placed
  outside in a position exposed to full sunshine all summer. Tenore, an
  Italian botanist, named this species <i>O. vulgaris</i>, and this
  mistake has led others to consider the North American <i>O.
  vulgaris</i> (true) and <i>O. Ficus-indica</i> as one and the same
  species.</p>

  <p><b><a name="ograh" id="ograh">O. Grahami</a></b>
  (Graham's).&mdash;This is one of several species of Opuntia which are
  remarkable in having thick, fleshy roots, not unlike those of the
  Dahlia. The joints are 2 in. long and 1 in. in diameter, cylindrical,
  with adpressed tubercles, &frac12; in. or more long, each tubercle
  bearing a tuft of long, straight, radiating spines. Flowers 2 in.
  across, yellow, borne on the ends of the ripened joints in June.
  Fruits 1&frac12; in. long and &frac34; in. wide, covered with
  stellate clusters of short, bristle-like spines. This plant is a
  native of Mexico, and is a recent introduction. From the nature of
  its roots, which are no doubt intended to serve as reservoirs for
  times of extreme drought, it should be grown in well-drained, sandy
  soil, and kept quite dry all winter. It requires stove treatment.</p>

  <p><b><a name="ohorr" id="ohorr">O. horrida</a></b>
  (horrid).&mdash;An erect, stout-stemmed plant, with flattened, green
  joints, about 5 in. long by 3 in. wide. Cushions 1 in. apart,
  composed of short, reddish bristles, and long, tawny red spines,
  about eight in each cushion, and of a peculiarly ferocious
  appearance&mdash;hence the specific name. The stoutest spines are 3
  in. long, and are sharp and strong as needles. This species (which is
  probably a native of Mexico) is deserving of a place in collections
  of Cactuses because of the character of its spines. Probably it is
  only a variety of <i>O. Tuna</i>. It requires warm-house
  treatment.</p>

  <p><b><a name="ohyst" id="ohyst">O. hystricina</a></b>
  (porcupine-like).&mdash;This beautiful species was discovered in the
  San Francisco Mountains mixed with <i>O. missouriensis</i>, to which
  it is nearly allied. It is spreading in habit, the joints 3 in. to 4
  in. long and broad; cushions &frac12; in. apart, rather large, with
  numerous spines, varying in length from &frac12; in. to 4 in., and
  short, yellowish bristles. Flowers large, yellow. Fruit 1 in., long,
  spiny. This plant is not known in English collections, but it is
  described by American botanists as being attractive and a free
  grower. As it is found along with <i>O. missouriensis</i>, it ought
  to prove hardy in England.</p>

  <p><b><a name="olept" id="olept">O. leptocaulis</a></b>
  (slender-stemmed).&mdash;This little Mexican species is chiefly
  remarkable for its fragile, numerous, twig-like joints, thickly
  dotted with tubercles and numerous spirally-arranged cushions of
  reddish bristles, with long, grey spines. It does not flower under
  cultivation. Requires stove treatment.</p>

  <p><b><a name="oleuc" id="oleuc">O. leucotricha</a></b>
  (white-haired).&mdash;An erect-stemmed kind, with flattened joints,
  ovate or oblong in shape, and bearing numerous cushions, &frac12; in.
  apart, of short bristles, with a large, central spine, and a few
  others rather shorter. When young these spines are rigid and
  needle-like; but as they get older they increase in length, and
  become soft, and curled like stiff, white hair. Young plants are
  noticeable for their small, subulate leaves of a bright red colour,
  whilst old examples are almost as interesting as the Old Man Cactus
  (<i>Pilocereus senilis</i>), the long, white, hair-like spines of the
  Opuntia hanging from the older joints in much the same manner as they
  do from the upper part of the stem of the Pilocereus. Flowers yellow,
  produced in June. This species is a native of Mexico, and requires
  stove treatment. Seeds of this, and, indeed, of a large proportion of
  the cultivated Opuntias, may be procured from seedsmen, and as they
  germinate quickly, and soon produce handsome little plants, a
  collection of Opuntias is thus very easily obtained.</p>

  <p><b><a name="omacr" id="omacr">O. macrocentra</a></b>
  (large-spurred).&mdash;A flat-jointed species, growing to a height of
  3 ft.; the joints large, almost circular, thinly compressed, and
  usually purplish in colour. Cushions about 1 in. apart, with spines
  often 3 in. long, of a greyish colour, and generally pointing
  downwards. Flowers 3 in. across, bright yellow; they are developed in
  May and June, on the upper edges of the youngest joints. This plant
  is a native of Mexico; it is at present rare, but the unusual colour
  of the joints, its compact, freely-branched habit, the extraordinary
  length of its spines, and the size of its flowers, ought to win for
  it many admirers. It is easily grown if kept in an intermediate
  house. Plants of it may be seen in the Kew collection.</p>

  <p><b><a name="omacro" id="omacro">O. macrorhiza</a></b>
  (large-rooted); Figs. 82, 83.&mdash;In this Texan species we have a
  combination of the principal characters for which the genus Opuntia
  is remarkable: The thick, fleshy roots, which are a supposed source
  of food, and which look like potatoes; the cylinder-shaped older
  stems, and the flattened, battledore-like joints; the tufts of
  bristles on the stems, and deciduous, longer spines on the joints;
  the large, beautiful, yellow flowers; and the small leaves on the
  newly-formed joints. In habit and flowers this kind resembles <i>O.
  Rafinesquii</i>; and if not quite hardy in England, it is
  nevertheless sufficiently so to thrive in any sunny position where it
  would be protected from frost and excessive wet. The accompanying
  illustrations represent the characters of this species so well that
  further description is not needed. The flowers are developed in early
  summer.</p>

  </div>

  <p><b><a name="omicr" id="omicr">O. microdasys</a></b> (small,
  thick).&mdash;This is a handsome little Mexican plant. Its flattened
  joints, which are nearly circular in outline, are thickly covered
  with little cushions of bright orange-yellow bristles, the cushions
  being so close together that the short bristles almost hide the green
  joints from view. The stems are semi-decumbent, and they branch
  somewhat freely. Flowers not seen. It thrives in a warm greenhouse
  temperature. The best examples of this pretty Opuntia are grafted on
  a robust-growing kind, the stock being about 1 ft. long, and the
  scion forming a compact head of pretty, healthy-looking joints.
  Treated in this way, this species is most interesting and attractive.
  It may also be grown on its own roots. There is a variety of it,
  named <i>rufida</i>, in which the bristles are reddish-brown.</p>

  <p><b><a name="omiss" id="omiss">O. missouriensis</a></b>
  (Missouri).&mdash;A stout, prostrate kind, forming large, spreading
  masses under favourable conditions. Joints broad, flattened, obovate,
  about 4 in. long by 2 in. wide, light green; spine-cushions less than
  1 in. apart, and composed of numerous small, white spines, with from
  one to four longer ones; these latter fall away when the joints get
  old. Leaves very short, with a little wool about their bases. Flowers
  3 in. in diameter, appearing from May onwards; petals yellow, dashed
  with rose, sometimes wholly rose-coloured or brick-red. Stamens deep
  red; pistil yellow, with a conical stigma. Fruit nearly round, spiny,
  about 2 in. long. A native of Wisconsin, and westward to the San
  Francisco Mountains; introduced in 1814. This species is as hardy as
  <i>O. Rafinesquii</i>, and thrives under similar treatment. It has
  stood 22 degs. of frost without suffering, requiring only protection
  from rain in winter. In North America it forms large, spreading
  masses on gravelly hillsides, and is much dreaded by travellers, and
  especially by horses; there it is usually covered with snow from
  Christmas to the following May.</p>

  <p><b><a name="omona" id="omona">O. monacantha</a></b>
  (one-spined).&mdash;A tall, robust plant, not unlike <i>O.
  Dillenii</i> in general habit. It has flat, large joints, oblong or
  ovate in outline, rather thinly compressed, and bearing grey cushions
  over 1 in. apart, with a solitary spine, 1&frac12; in. long,
  springing from the centre of each cushion, and pointing downwards.
  Flowers sulphur-yellow, 2&frac12; in. across, borne on the
  last-ripened joints in May, and abundant on well-grown plants. Fruits
  ovate, 2 in. long, green, with tufts of short, brown bristles; pulp
  edible. The species is a native of Brazil, but is now common in many
  tropical and sub-tropical countries. It is a free-growing kind, soon
  forming a large specimen if planted in a bed of old brick-rubble, or
  other light, well-drained soil, and kept in warm greenhouse
  temperature.</p>

  <p><b><a name="onigr" id="onigr">O. nigricans</a></b> (blackish);
  Bot. Mag. 1557.&mdash;Stem stout, erect, becoming hard and woody when
  old. Joints flat, oval in outline, 5 in. to 8 in. long. Cushions
  1&frac12; in. apart, composed of short reddish-brown bristles and two
  or three long stout spines, which are yellow when young, but almost
  black when ripe. Flowers produced on the young, ripened joints,
  orange-red, about 3 in. across and developed in August and September.
  Fruit pear-shaped, rich crimson when ripe. Introduced from Brazil in
  1795. This well-marked species thrives in a warm greenhouse. It
  branches freely, and has a healthy aspect at all times. It is
  represented at Kew by very large specimens; one of them, which was
  recently cut down, had a stem 12 ft. high and an enormous head of
  dark, green joints. Its head was planted as a cutting.</p>

  <p><b><a name="oocci" id="oocci">O. occidentalis</a></b> (Western).
  &mdash;Stem stout, woody, with innumerable branches, wide-spreading,
  often bent to the ground. Joints 9 in. to 12 in. long by about 6 in.
  broad, flattened, as many as 100 on one plant. Cushions nearly 2 in.
  apart, with small, closely-set bristles and straight spines from
  &frac12; in. to l&frac12; in. long. Flowers produced in June on the
  ripened joints, nearly 4 in. in diameter, orange-yellow. Fruit 2 in.
  long, "very juicy, but of a sour and disagreeable taste." This is an
  exceptionally fine plant when allowed sufficient space to develop its
  enormous branches and joints; it is a native of the Western slopes of
  the Californian mountains. It should be planted in a bed of rough,
  stony soil, in a dry greenhouse. Possibly it is hardy, but it does
  not appear to have been grown out of doors in England.</p>

  <p><b><a name="oparm" id="oparm">O. Parmentieri</a></b>
  (Parmentier's).&mdash;Stem erect. Joints cylindrical, "like little
  cucumbers." Cushions about 1 in. apart, arranged in spiral rows, and
  composed of short, reddish bristles, with two or three straw-coloured
  spines, 1 in. long. Flowers reddish, small. The plant is a native of
  Paraguay, and is rarely heard of in cultivation. It requires stove
  treatment.</p>

  <p><b><a name="oparr" id="oparr">O. Parryi</a></b>
  (Parry's).&mdash;Stem short. Joints club-shaped, 4 in. to 6 in. long,
  very spiny, the cushions elevated on ridge-like tubercles. Bristles
  few, coarse, and long. Spines very numerous, varying in length from
  &frac14; in. to 1&frac12; in.; central one in each cushion much the
  broadest, and flattened like a knife-blade, the others being more or
  less triangular. Flowers yellowish-green, on the terminal joints,
  which are clothed with star-shaped clusters of bristle-like spines,
  the flowers springing from the apex of the joint, and measuring
  1&frac12; in. across. A native of Mexico, where it grows on gravelly
  plains. This distinct plant is in cultivation at Kew, in a warm
  greenhouse, but it has not yet flowered.</p>

  <p><b><a name="orafi" id="orafi">O. Rafinesquii</a></b>
  (Rafinesque's); Fig. 84.&mdash;A low, prostrate, spreading plant,
  seldom exceeding 1 ft. in height, the main branches keeping along the
  ground, the younger ones being erect. The latter are composed of
  flat, obovate joints, 4 in. to 5 in. long by 3 in. in width, fresh
  green in colour; spines very few, mostly only on the upper edge of
  the last-made joints, single, or sometimes two or three from each
  spine-cushion, 1 in. long, straight, whitish, soon falling off;
  cushion composed of very fine reddish bristles and whitish wool;
  leaves very small, falling early. The branches become cylindrical and
  woody with age. Flowers 2 in. to 4 in. in diameter, bright
  sulphur-yellow, with a reddish tint in the centre; in form they are
  like a shallow cup, the numerous stamens occupying the middle. They
  are produced in great abundance on the margins of the youngest
  joints, as many as fifty open flowers having been counted on a single
  specimen at one time. Fruit pear-shaped, 1&frac12; in. to 2 in. long,
  naked, edible, somewhat acid and sweetish. The flowering season is
  from July to September; the native country, Wisconsin to Kentucky,
  and westward to Arkansas and Missouri. This species, introduced about
  twenty years ago, has only recently been brought prominently before
  English gardeners. It is a very ornamental and interesting plant for
  outdoor cultivation, and when once established gives no trouble. For
  the first year or two after planting it requires watching, as, until
  the basal joints harden and become woody, they are liable to rot in
  wet weather. A large-flowered form, known as <i>grandiflora</i>, is
  cultivated in American gardens.</p>

  <p><b><a name="orose" id="orose">O. rosea</a></b> (rose-coloured);
  Fig. 85.&mdash;Stem erect, branching freely. Joints varying in length
  from 2 in. to 6 in., not flattened, with ridge-like tubercles,
  bearing on their points small cushions of very fine bristles and
  tufts of pale yellowish spines about &frac12; in. long, and all
  pointing upwards. Flowers on the ends of the ripened growths of the
  year, usually clustered, 2 in. across, bright rose-coloured; they are
  developed in June. A rare species from Brazil, and one which, as the
  illustration shows, is both distinct and handsome enough to be
  classed amongst the most select. It requires a stove temperature.</p>

  <p><b><a name="osalm" id="osalm">O. Salmiana</a></b> (Prince
  Salm-Dyck's).&mdash;Stem erect, branching freely, the branches at
  right angles to the stem. Joints from 1 in. to 6 in. long,
  cylindrical, smooth, &frac12; in. in diameter, clothed with small
  cushions of soft, short bristles, and one or two longish spines.
  Flowers produced in September, 2 in. across, yellow, streaked with
  red, of short duration. Fruit egg-shaped, 1 in. long, crimson. This
  species is a native of Brazil, whence it was introduced in 1850. It
  requires to be grown in an intermediate house. It is a charming
  little Cactus, and quite exceptional among Opuntias in the colour and
  abundance of its flowers, and in the rich colour of its numerous
  fruits, which usually remain on the plant several months. The plant,
  too, has the merit of keeping dwarf and compact. The small joints
  separate very easily from the branches, and every one of them will
  root and grow into a plant. There is something very remarkable in the
  development of the fruits of this kind. A small branch, or joint,
  grows to its full length, and a flower-bud appears in the apex. If
  examined at this stage, it will be seen that the ovary occupies only
  a very shallow cavity in the top of the branch. After flowering, this
  ovary grows into the branch, and ultimately the whole branch is
  transformed into a pulpy fruit, with the seeds scattered all through
  the pulp. This peculiarity is well shown in <i>O. salmiana</i>, and
  the development of the fruit can be very easily watched. Many of the
  small branches do not flower, although they change to a red colour
  like the fruits.</p>

  <p><b><a name="ospin" id="ospin">O. spinosissima</a></b> (very
  spiny).&mdash;Stem erect, woody. Joints very flat and thin, deep
  green, ovate or rotund, from 6 in. to 1 ft. long. Cushions 1 in.
  apart. Bristles very short. Spines in clusters of about five, the
  longest 2 in. in length, brownish-yellow. Flowers reddish-orange,
  small, usually only 2 in. across, produced in June. A native of South
  America; naturalised in many parts of the Old World. The stem becomes
  cylindrical with age, and sometimes is devoid of branches for about 5
  ft. from the ground. The plant requires stove treatment. Probably
  this kind is only a form of <i>O. Tuna</i>.</p>

  <p><b><a name="osubu" id="osubu">O. subulata</a></b> (awl-shaped).
  &mdash;Stem erect, cylindrical, even below, channelled and tubercled
  above, about 2 in. in diameter. Joints long and branch-like, with
  tufts of short, white hair on the apices of the tubercles, and one or
  two white, needle-like spines from &frac12; in. to 1 in. long. At the
  base of each tuft, from the apex to 1 ft. or more down the younger
  branches, there is a fleshy, green, awl-shaped leaf, from 2 in. to 5
  in. long. Ultimately the leaves and spines fall away, the tubercles
  are levelled down, and the mature stem is regular and cylindrical,
  with tufts of white setae scattered over it. Flowers small, produced
  in spring; sepals 2 in. long, green, deciduous; petals small, dull
  purple, usually about eight in each flower. Fruit pear-shaped, 4 in.
  long; seeds very large, nearly &frac12; in. long and wide. This
  handsome South American species was the subject of an interesting
  communication to the <i>Gardeners' Chronicle</i>, in 1884, from Dr.
  Engelmann. It had previously been known as a Pereskia from the fact
  of its leaves being persistent and very large. In its leaves,
  flowers, and seeds, <i>O. subulata</i> is one of the most interesting
  of the genus. It is easily grown in a warm greenhouse, and deserves a
  place in all collections of Cactuses.</p>

  <p><b><a name="otuna" id="otuna">O. Tuna</a></b> (native name); Fig.
  86.&mdash;An erect-stemmed, flat-jointed, robust-growing species.
  Joints ovate, 4 in. to 9 in. long, with cushions 1 in. apart,
  composed of short, fulvous bristles, and several long, needle-shaped,
  unequal, yellowish spines. Flowers borne on the upper edges of the
  last-ripened joints, 3 in. across, reddish-orange, produced in July.
  Fruit rich carmine, about 3 in. long, pear-shaped. The plant is a
  native of the West Indies, &amp;c., and was introduced in 1731. It
  has already been stated, under <i>O. spinosissima</i>, that there is
  a close similarity between that species and <i>O. Tuna</i>. We
  suspect, also, that <i>O. nigricans</i> is another near relation of
  these two. They are much alike in all characters, and they require
  the same treatment. <i>O. Tuna</i> has been seen as much as 20 ft. in
  height.</p>

  <p><b><a name="otuni" id="otuni">O. tunicata</a></b>
  (coated-spined).&mdash;Stem sub-erect, cylindrical. Joints
  club-shaped, variable in length, about 2 in. in diameter. When young
  the surface is broken up into numerous oblong tubercles, each bearing
  a small cushion of whitish, short hairs, and about half a dozen white
  spines, unequal in length, the longest stout, and inclosed in a hard
  sheath, which becomes broken and ragged when old. Flowers not known.
  A native of Mexico, and introduced in 1840. It requires stove
  treatment.</p>

  <p><b><a name="ovulg" id="ovulg">O. vulgaris</a></b> (common); Bot.
  Mag. 2393.&mdash;A low, prostrate, spreading plant. Joints short,
  oval, flattened, thicker than in <i>O. missouriensis</i>, 3 in. long
  by about 2 in. broad. Spine-cushions &frac34; in. apart; tufts very
  small, with, occasionally, a long spine. Leaves fleshy, very small.
  Flowers 2 in. across, pale sulphur-yellow. Fruits nearly smooth,
  1&frac12; in. long, brown when ripe, with a strong disagreeable
  odour. The flowers are produced freely in June. The plant grows wild
  in Mexico, and extends up to New York, usually near the coast. It is
  now common in many parts of Europe, where it has become naturalised.
  In Madeira it has taken possession of all waste land, and is
  perfectly at home there. In England it was cultivated by Gerard
  nearly 300 years ago. It grows rapidly if planted in stony soil, in a
  position exposed to full sunshine, where it will creep along the
  ground, and root all along its stems, which rarely get elevated more
  than 6 in. from the ground. This species and <i>O. Ficus-indica</i>
  are confused by some authors, owing, no doubt, to the name <i>O.
  vulgaris</i> having been given by a botanist to the latter, which is
  a much larger and very different-looking plant. <i>O. vulgaris</i> is
  capable of withstanding our winters out of doors.</p>

  <p><b><a name="owhip" id="owhip">O. Whipplei</a></b> (Captain
  Whipple's).&mdash;Stem usually prostrate, with slender, elongated
  branches, which are cylindrical when old, broken up into short joints
  when young. Joints varying in length from 2 in. to 1 ft., less than 1
  in. in diameter. Cushions small, round. Spines white, variable in
  number, and arranged in tufts on the ends of the tubercles, one being
  1 in. long, the others shorter. Flowers nearly 2 in. in diameter,
  red, borne in a cluster on the ends of the last-ripened joints in
  June. Fruit 1 in. long, with a cavity in the top. A compact, Mexican
  species, with crowded branches, and very free-flowering. It requires
  stove treatment. <i>O. Whipplei</i> is related to <i>O.
  arborescens</i>, from which, however, it is easily distinguished by
  the latter having a stout central spine and numerous radiating
  ones.</p>

  <p>Of the 150 species of Opuntia known, about one-third have been
  selected for description here, and amongst these will be found all
  the best-marked kinds in the genus, and most of those of which we
  have any knowledge. Botanists find good specific characters in the
  size and structure of the seeds, in the character of the fruits,
  &amp;c.; but for horticultural purposes these are of little or no

  <h2>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>
  <hr />

  <h3>THE GENUS PERESKIA.</h3>

  <h5>(Named in honour of Nicholas F. Peresk, a botanist of
  Provence.)</h5>

  <div class="figleft">
    <img src="images/fancy_T.jpg" width="50" height="118" alt="T" />
  </div><br />

  <p>HE thirteen species included in the genus Pereskia differ so
  markedly from all other kinds of Cactus, that at first sight one can
  scarcely believe they are true Cactuses, closely related to Cereus
  and Epiphyllum. They have erect or trailing stems and branches, and
  usually form dense, large bushes; the branches are woody and thin,
  and bear large, laurel-like leaves, which remain on the plants
  several years&mdash;so that they may be termed evergreen. They have,
  however, the spine-cushions, the tufts of woolly hair and stout
  spines, and the floral characters which distinguish Cactuses from
  other plants; they are also succulent, the leaves and young branches
  being soft and fleshy. They appear to have the same peculiar
  provision for enabling them to bear long periods of drought without
  suffering that characterises the more familiar forms of Cactuses. The
  development of the spines in this genus is different from what takes
  place in all other spiny plants of this order. In the latter the
  spines are stoutest and most numerous on the younger parts of the
  plant, the older or woody parts being either spineless, through
  having cast them, or much less spiny than when they were younger.
  Thus, in Opuntia we find few or no spines on the old parts of the
  stems of even such species as <i>O. horrida</i>, <i>O. nigricans</i>,
  &amp;c. In Echinocactus, too, the spines about the base of old plants
  are much fewer, if not entirely cast off, than on the upper part. In
  Pereskia the contrary is the case. Taking <i>P. aculeata</i> as an
  example, this is best known in gardens as having branches about as
  thick as a goose-quill, with ovate leaves, at the base of which there
  is a pair of curved spines, &frac14; in. long, and shaped like cats'
  claws. But this plant when it gets old has a stem 3 in. in diameter,
  and clothed down to the ground with cushions of spines fixed firmly
  in the bark, each cushion composed of from twenty to fifty spines,
  and each spine 1 in. or more in length. From two to six new spines
  are developed in the centre of each healthy cushion annually. It
  would be absolutely impossible for any animal to climb an old stem of
  a Pereskia. In <i>P. Bleo</i> the spines are 2 in. long, and the
  cushions are much larger.</p>

  <p>The flowers of Pereskias are borne singly or in panicles, at the
  ends of the young, ripened branches. In shape, each flower may be
  compared to a single Rose, the petals being flat and spreading, and
  the numerous stamens forming a compact cluster in the centre. The
  stigma is erect, and divided at the top into four or more rays. The
  fruit is a berry shaped like a Gooseberry, and covered with minute
  clusters of short bristles.</p>

  <p>All the species are found in tropical America and the West
  Indies.</p>

  <p><b>Cultivation</b>.&mdash;Although several of the kinds of
  Pereskia are sufficiently ornamental to be deserving of a place in
  gardens as flowering plants, yet they are rarely cultivated&mdash;in
  England, at least&mdash;for any other purpose than that of forming
  stocks upon which Epiphyllums and other Cacti are grafted. Only two
  species are used, viz., <i>P. aculeata</i> and <i>P. Bleo</i>, the
  former being much the more popular of the two; whilst <i>P. Bleo</i>,
  on account of the stoutness of its stems, is employed for only the
  most robust kinds of grafts.</p>

  <p><b>Propagation</b>.&mdash;Both the above-named species may be
  propagated to any extent, as every bit of branch with a leaf and eye
  attached is capable of rooting and soon forming a stock. The practice
  among those who use Pereskias as stocks for Epiphyllums is as
  follows: Cuttings of <i>P. aculeata</i> are planted in sandy soil, in
  boxes, and placed on a shelf in a stove till rooted. In about a month
  they are ready to be planted singly in 3 in. pots, any light soil
  being used; and each plant is fastened to a stake 1 ft. long. They
  are kept in a warm, moist house, all lateral shoots being cut away,
  and the leader encouraged to grow as tall as possible in the year.
  From December the plants are kept dry to induce the wood to ripen,
  preparatory to their being used for grafting in February. Stocks 9
  in. or 1 ft. high are thus formed. If taller stocks are required, the
  plants must be grown on till of the required length and firmness.
  Large plants may be trained against a wall or along the rafters in a
  warm house; and when of the required size, the branches may be
  spurred back, and Epiphyllums, slender Cereuses, and similar plants,
  grafted upon them. In this way very fine masses of the latter may be
  obtained in much less time than if they were grown from small
  plants.</p>

  <h3>SPECIES.</h3>

  <p><b><a name="pacul" id="pacul">P. aculeata</a></b> (prickly); West
  Indian or Barbados Gooseberry.&mdash;Stem woody, more or less erect,
  branching freely, and forming a dense bush about 6 ft. high. Young
  branches leafy; old ones brown, leafless, clothed with large cushions
  of long, stout, brown spines, sometimes 2 in. in length. Leaves
  alternate, with very short petioles, at the base of which is a pair
  of short spines, and a small tuft of wool in the axil; blade 3 in.
  long by 2 in. broad, soft, fleshy, shining green. Flowers
  semi-transparent, white, in terminal panicles; sepals and petals
  &frac34; in. long by &frac14; in. wide; stamens in a large, spreading
  cluster, white, with yellow anthers. Ovary covered with small
  cushions of short bristles, with sometimes a solitary spine in the
  centre of each cushion. Fruit 1 in. long, egg-shaped, red, edible.
  There is a large plant of this in the Succulent House at Kew which
  flowers almost annually, but it has never ripened fruits. In the West
  Indies it is a very common shrub, whilst at the Cape of Good Hope it
  is used for fences&mdash;and a capital one it makes.</p>

  <p><b><a name="paculr" id="paculr">P. a. rubescens</a></b>
  (reddish).&mdash;This variety has narrower, longer leaves, which are
  glaucous-green above and tinged with red below; the spines on the old
  stems are shorter and more numerous in each cushion. This requires
  the same treatment as the type.</p>

  <p><b><a name="pbleo" id="pbleo">P. Bleo</a></b> (native name); Fig.
  87.&mdash;A stout, branching shrub, having an erect stem, 3 in. or
  more in diameter, with green bark and very large cushions of spines;
  cushion a round, hard mass of short, woolly hair, from which the
  spines&mdash;about fifty in each cushion&mdash;radiate in all
  directions; longest spines 2 in. or more in length; one or two new
  ones are developed annually, and these are bright red when young,
  almost black when ripe; young branches &frac14; in. to &frac12; in.
  in diameter. Leaves &frac12; in. apart, 3 in. to 6 in. long by 1 in.
  to 2 in. wide, oblong, pointed, with short petioles, and a small tuft
  of short, brown hair, with three or more reddish spines, in the axil
  of each. Flowers on the ends of the young, ripened branches,
  clustered in the upper leaf-axils, each flower 2 in. across, and
  composed of a regular circle of rosy-red petals, with a cluster of
  whitish stamens in the centre. They remain on the plant several
  weeks. Native of New Grenada. Probably <i>P. grandiflora</i> is the
  same as this, or a slightly different form of it. A large specimen
  may be obtained in a year or two by planting it in a well-drained bed
  of loam, in a warm, sunny house. It blossoms almost all summer if
  allowed to make strong growth. Pretty little flowering plants may be
  had by taking ripened growths from an old plant, and treating them as
  cuttings till rooted. In the following spring they are almost certain
  to produce flowers. Plants 1 ft. high, bearing a cluster of flowers,
  are thus annually obtained at Kew. Fig. 87 represents a short,
  stunted branch, probably from a specimen grown in a pot. When planted
  out, the leaves and spine-cushions are farther apart.</p>

  spines. Flowers rosy-red, terminal on the ripened young shoots, and
  composed of a whorl of broad, overlapping petals, with a cluster of
  stamens in the centre, the whole measuring nearly 2 in. across. This
  species is a native of Mexico; it grows and flowers freely if kept in
  a warm house.</p>

  <h3>THE GENUS RHIPSALIS</h3>.

  <h5>(From <i>rhips</i>, a willow-branch; referring to the flexible,
  wand-like branches of some of the kinds.)</h5>

  <div class="figleft">
    <img src="images/fancy_A.gif" width="54" height="113" alt="A" />
  </div><br />

  <p>BOUT thirty species of Rhipsalis are known, most of them more
  peculiar than ornamental, although everyone is in some way
  interesting. They are remarkable for the great variety in form and
  habit presented by the different kinds, some of them much less
  resembling Cactuses than other plants. Thus, in <i>R. Cassytha</i>,
  the long, fleshy, whip-like branches and white berries are very
  similar to Mistletoe; <i>R. salicornoides</i>, with its leafless,
  knotty branches, resembles a Salicornia, or Marsh Samphire; another
  is like a Mesembryanthemum; and so on. The flowers are usually small,
  and composed of numerous linear sepals and petals, arranged more or
  less like a star, with a cluster of thin stamens in the centre, and
  an erect, rayed stigma. In the flat-jointed kinds, the flowers are
  developed singly, in notches along the margins of the young, ripened
  joints; in the knotted, Samphire-like kinds, they are borne on the
  ends of the branches; and in those with short, fleshy, leaf-like
  joints, they are usually placed on what appear to be flower-joints.
  Although the branches of these plants are usually altogether unlike
  the rest of the Order, yet occasionally they develop joints which are
  furrowed, and bear clusters of spines exactly as in the commoner
  forms of Cactuses.</p>

  <p>The geographical distribution of Rhipsalis is exceptional. It is
  the only genus of Cactuses that has representatives in the Old World,
  excluding, of course, those which have been introduced by man. The
  bulk of the kinds of Rhipsalis occur in Central and South America,
  and the West Indies; but one&mdash;viz., <i>R. Cassytha</i>&mdash;is
  also found in Africa, Mauritius, Madagascar, and Ceylon, as well as
  in tropical America. Several other species are found in Madagascar,
  some of them only recent discoveries. The occurrence of similar or
  even identical plants in tropical America and Madagascar has its
  analogy in the Animal Kingdom as represented in the two
  countries.</p>

  <p><b>Cultivation</b>.&mdash;All the species appear to grow well and
  flower freely under cultivation, the slowest grower being, perhaps,
  <i>R. sarmentacea</i>. In their natural homes they are invariably
  found either on trees or rocks, seldom or never on the ground; but in
  greenhouses they may be grown in pots, a few being happiest when
  suspended near the glass. They do not like bright sunshine, nor
  should they be kept in a very shaded, moist position. There is a good
  collection of kinds in the Succulent-house at Kew.</p>

  <p><b>Propagation</b>.&mdash;Seeds of Rhipsalis ripen freely, and
  these, if sown on sandy soil, and placed on a shelf in a warm house,
  germinate in a few days. The development of the seedlings is
  exceptionally interesting, as the vegetative organs of all the kinds
  are very similar, and Cactus-like; the gradual transition from this
  character to the diverse forms which many of the species assume when
  mature is quite phenomenal. Cuttings will strike at almost any time,
  if planted in sandy soil and kept in a close, warm house till rooted.
  Some of the kinds thrive best when grafted on to a thin-stemmed
  Cereus. Treated in this way, <i>R. sarmentacea</i> makes 6 in. of
  growth in a season; whereas, on its own roots it would take about
  five years to grow as much.</p>

  <p>The following is a selection of the species cultivated in gardens.
  The genus <i>Lepismium</i> is now included in Rhipsalis.</p>

  <h3>SPECIES.</h3>

  <p><b><a name="rcass" id="rcass">R. Cassytha</a></b> (derivation not
  known).&mdash;A pendent shrub, 4 ft. or more high, growing on rocks
  and the mossy trunks of trees. Branches numerous, flexuous, with
  small branchlets or joints springing from the ends in clusters,
  smooth, round, the thickness of whipcord, leafless, with numerous
  brown, dot-like marks scattered over the surface; under a lens these
  dots are seen to be tufts of very fine hairs. Flowers on the sides of
  the young branches, small, greenish-white, short-lived; they are
  developed in September, and are succeeded by white berries, exactly
  like those of the Mistletoe, whence the name Mistletoe Cactus, by
  which this species is known. An interesting and easily-grown warm
  greenhouse plant, native of tropical America, Africa, &amp;c. It was
  introduced in 1758.</p>

  <p><b><a name="rcomm" id="rcomm">R. commune</a></b> (common); Bot.
  Mag. 3763.&mdash;Stem straggling, branching freely, growing to a
  length of several feet. Branches jointed; joints varying in length,
  triangular, the angles compressed, and notched along the margins;
  notches regular, and bearing tufts of whitish hair. Strong plants
  produce joints over 1 in. in width. Flowers white, tinged with
  purple, springing singly from the notches, and composed of eight to
  twelve sepals and petals. Stamens and stigma erect, white, the latter
  four-rayed. This species is a native of Brazil, and was introduced in
  1830; Flowering-season, October to December. It may be grown in a
  warm greenhouse, and treated as a basket-plant or as a small
  pot-shrub. Syn. <i>Lepismium commune</i>.</p>

  <p><b><a name="rcris" id="rcris">R. crispata</a></b>
  (curled).&mdash;Stem branching freely. Branches jointed and flat,
  like Epiphyllum. Margins of joints notched, and slightly curled.
  Flowers small, white, produced singly, in November and December, in
  the notches on the younger joints. Fruits white, pea-like, rather
  rarely ripened. A free-growing, compact stove shrub, with a bright
  green, healthy appearance. The similarity of its branches to
  Epiphyllum led to its being included in that genus by Haworth.</p>

  <p><b><a name="rcrisp" id="rcrisp">R. c. purpurea</a></b>
  (purple).&mdash;This variety has larger, broader joints, which are
  bronzy-purple in colour.</p>

  <p><b><a name="rfasc" id="rfasc">R. fasciculata</a></b>
  (cluster-branched); Bot. Mag. 3079.&mdash;Stems terete, as thick as a
  goose-quill. Branches usually in clusters, and sometimes jointed,
  green, with small red dots and little tufts of fine, hair-like
  bristles. Flowers white, produced in March, springing irregularly
  from the older branches, small, star-like. Fruit a white berry. From
  its habit of growing on trees, and the character of its stems and
  fruit, this plant has been called parasitical. It is, however, only
  indebted to the tree on which is grows for moisture, for it thrives
  if planted in a pot or basket in ordinary soil, and kept in a stove
  temperature. It is a native of Brazil, and was introduced in
  1831.</p>

  <p><b><a name="rfloc" id="rfloc">R. floccosa</a></b>
  (woolly).&mdash;Stems as in <i>R. Cassytha</i>, but thicker, longer,
  and with the branchlets in compact clusters on the ends of the long,
  arching branches. The dots marking the position of the microscopic
  hair-tufts are in small depressions. Flowers and fruit as in <i>R.
  Cassytha</i>, of which this might reasonably be called a variety.
  This species requires warm-house temperature.</p>

  <p><b><a name="rfuna" id="rfuna">R. funalis</a></b> (cord-like); Fig.
  89.&mdash;Stem straggling, branched. Branches numerous, composed of
  long, terete joints, rather thicker than a goose-quill,
  glaucous-green, slightly roughened on the surface, with depressions
  for the dot-like cushions. Branchlets usually fascicled and
  spreading. Flowers white, produced in spring, on the sides of the
  young joints, 1 in. across, large for the genus. Introduced from
  Central America about 1830. An easily-grown plant, sturdy, rather
  straggling, but very free-flowering. In old specimens the branches
  become semi-pendulous. It grows best when kept in a warm house. Syn.
  <i>R. grandiflora</i>.</p>

  </div>

  <p><b><a name="rhoul" id="rhoul">R. Houlletii</a></b> (Houllet's);
  Bot. Mag. 6089.&mdash;Stems long, graceful, branching freely, round
  and twig-like, or with broad wings, as in Phyllocactus. Winged or
  flattened portions notched, and bearing a flower in each notch.
  Flowers stalkless, with pointed, straw-coloured petals, forming a
  shallow cup about &frac34; in. across the top. Stamens and pistil
  white, with a tinge of red at the base. Flowering-season, November.
  Under cultivation, this Brazilian species forms a small, straggling
  shrub, about 3 ft. high, but in its native woods its stems are many
  feet long, and pendulous from the branches of trees. It may be grown
  in a warm house, in a pot, and its branches supported by a stake; or
  its lower stems may be fastened against a piece of soft fern-stem,
  into which its numerous stem-roots penetrate freely. In the winter it
  should be kept almost dry. The flowers remain fresh for several days,
  and are fragrant. A well-grown plant, when in flower, is an
  interesting and pretty object. It is the most ornamental kind.</p>

  <p><b><a name="rknig" id="rknig">R. Knightii</a></b>
  (Knight's).&mdash;Stems and joints as in <i>R. commune</i>. Wings of
  joints usually broad, with red margins, and the hair in the notches
  in a dense tuft, nearly 1 in. long, pure white, and silk-like.
  Flowers small, white. This species, which thrives best under
  warm-house treatment, is a native of Brazil, and is usually grown
  only for its curious, Cereus-like stems. It forms a straggling plant
  about 1 ft. high. Syn. <i>Lepismium Knightii, Cereus
  Knightii</i>.</p>

  <p><b><a name="rmese" id="rmese">R. mesembryanthemoides</a></b>
  (Mesembryanthemum-like); Bot. Mag. 3O78.&mdash;A small, compact
  plant, with woody stems, densely covered with little fleshy, conical
  joints, resembling very closely the leaves of some of the
  Mesembryanthemums. They are green, with a few red dots, each bearing
  a very small tuft of the finest hair-like spines. The flowers are
  developed in March, from the sides of the small joints; they are
  &frac12; in. across, and yellowish-white. Fruit a small, white, round
  berry. Native of South America, whence it was introduced in 1831.
  When grown in a warm house, in a small, round, wire basket, filled
  with peat and sphagnum, this little Cactus forms a pretty tuft, which
  in the spring produces large numbers of white, star-like flowers.</p>

  <p><b><a name="rmyos" id="rmyos">R. myosurus</a></b> (mouse-tailed);
  Bot. Mag. 3755.&mdash;Stems dependent, several feet long, branching
  freely, jointed, with three or four angles or wings; the angles
  flattened, reddish, notched in the margin, and bearing a tuft of
  white, silky hairs in each notch. Flowers small, yellow, tinged with
  red, springing from the notches; produced in July. Fruit not seen. A
  native of Brazil; introduced in 1839. This species resembles some of
  the angular-stemmed kinds of Cereus. It grows freely and flowers
  annually, if planted in a basket of fibrous soil, and suspended near
  the glass in a warm greenhouse or stove. It is attractive even when
  not in flower, owing to the form of its stems and the tufts of long,
  silky, white hair which spring from the notches. Syn. <i>Lepismium
  myosurus</i>.</p>

  <p><b><a name="rpach" id="rpach">R. pachyptera</a></b>
  (thick-winged); Bot. Mag. 2820.&mdash;Stem woody; branches jointed,
  flattened as in Phyllocactus, with deep notches; width of joints, 2
  in. or more. Flowers small, yellowish-white, borne singly in the
  notches in November. Fruit a small, white berry, rarely ripened. A
  sturdy, comparatively uninteresting stove plant, introduced from
  Brazil in 1830. Syn. <i>Cactus alatus</i>.</p>

  <p><b><a name="rpara" id="rpara">R. paradoxa</a></b>
  (paradoxical).&mdash;Stems trailing, with numerous long branches of
  most extraordinary form. Imagine a three-angled, fleshy branch, often
  several feet in length, the angles winged, about &frac12; in. deep,
  green, with smooth, reddish margins. At intervals of about 2 in. the
  branch has the appearance of having been twisted half round. There is
  no other plant with branches anything like these. Flowers produced in
  November, in the apex of the interrupted angles, small, white. Fruit
  seldom ripened. A native of Brazil, whence it was introduced in 1837.
  There is a fine example of this trained along a rafter in the
  Succulent-house at Kew. The numerous branches hang down several feet
  from the rafter, and have a most extraordinary appearance. This
  species requires stove treatment.</p>

  <p><b><a name="rpend" id="rpend">R. penduliflora</a></b>
  (pendulous-flowered).&mdash;A small, thin-stemmed plant, with smooth,
  green branches, no thicker than whipcord, and numerous fascicled or
  clustered, small joints, &frac12; in. long, green, with red dots,
  angular when young. Flowers on the tips of the terminal joints, pale
  yellow, &frac12; in. across, developing in August. Fruit white,
  Mistletoe-like. This species was introduced from tropical America in
  1877, and requires stove treatment.</p>

  <p><b><a name="rpendl" id="rpendl">R. p. laxa</a></b>
  (loose).&mdash;This variety has the branches curving, and more
  pendulous; in other respects it resembles the type, and requires the
  same treatment.</p>

  <p><b><a name="rpent" id="rpent">R. pentaptera</a></b>
  (five-winged).&mdash;Stems erect; branches stiff, long-jointed, with
  five wing-like angles, slightly spiral, the angles notched at
  intervals of 1 in. Flowers in the notches, &frac12; in. across,
  white, produced in August. Fruit a white, Mistletoe-like berry. A
  curious plant from Brazil, and introduced in 1836. In stove
  temperature it forms a compact pot-shrub, 2 ft. high, and is worth
  growing on account of its singular stems.</p>

  <p><b><a name="rrhom" id="rrhom">R. rhombea</a></b>
  (diamond-branched).&mdash;Stems and branches as in <i>R.
  crispata</i>, but without the wavy margins, and with more elongated
  joints. Flowers small, white, produced in the notches of the joints
  in November. Fruit a shining, milk-white berry. A compact plant from
  Brazil, worth growing for its bright green, leaf-like stems. It
  should be grown in pots, in stove temperature, and encouraged to form
  a globose bush.</p>

  <p><b><a name="rsagl" id="rsagl">R. Saglionis</a></b> (Saglio's);
  Bot. Mag. 4039.&mdash;A tiny plant, similar in habit to <i>R.
  penduliflora</i>, but with brown branches, the small joints angled,
  and bearing silky hairs. The branches and joints are set at zigzag
  angles. Flowers pale yellow, produced in autumn on the younger
  joints. Fruits white, Mistletoe-like. A small, delicate plant from
  Buenos Ayres, not more than 6 in. high. This species requires stove
  treatment.</p>

  <p><b><a name="rsali" id="rsali">R. salicornoides</a></b>
  (Glasswort-like); Bot. Mag. 2461.&mdash;Stem woody when old, brown,
  jointed like hens' toes, not quite as thick as a goose-quill.
  Branches in clusters; joints &frac12; in. to 1 in. long, the lower
  half much thinner than the upper, so that the joints look like a
  number of superposed, miniature clubs. Flowers pretty, on the ends of
  the terminal joints, yellow, becoming red with age. An erect plant, 3
  ft. or more high, introduced from Brazil in 1830. The joints are
  clustered on the upper part of the stem. When in flower in spring
  this is an attractive and very remarkable-looking plant. It thrives
  best in stove temperature.</p>

  <p><b><a name="rsalis" id="rsalis">R. s. stricta</a></b>
  (straight).&mdash;This variety has the joints all pointing upwards,
  and is much more compact than the type.</p>

  <p><b><a name="rsarm" id="rsarm">R. sarmentacea</a></b>
  (runner-stemmed); Fig. 90.&mdash;A creeping, prostrate plant, with
  round stems as thick as a goose-quill, and attaching themselves to
  tree-trunks or other bodies by means of numerous adventitious roots,
  which spring from the under side of the stems. Surface of stem
  furrowed, and covered with numerous small clusters of short,
  hair-like, whitish spines. Flowers 1 in. across, springing from the
  sides of the stems, with pointed, creamy-white petals; stamens
  spreading; stigma erect, four-lobed. Fruit small, currant-like. This
  is a pretty little species, introduced from Brazil in 1858; it is,
  however, a very slow grower, plants ten years old being only a few
  inches in diameter. It should be grown in stove temperature, in a
  basket of peat fibre, or, better still, on a piece of soft fern-stem.
  It is always found on the branches or trunks of trees when growing
  wild.</p>

  <p><b><a name="rswar" id="rswar">R. Swartziana</a></b>
  (Swartz's).&mdash;Older stems three-angled, young ones flattened,
  jointed; joints 2 in. broad, stiff with deep notches. Flowers in the
  notches, small, white, produced in June. This species is a native of
  Jamaica, and was introduced in 1810. A stiff, ungraceful plant, about
  2 ft. high, very similar in its branches to a Phyllocactus. This
  species requires the temperature of a stove.</p>

  <p><b><a name="rtrig" id="rtrig">R. trigona</a></b>
  (triangular).&mdash;Habit straggling; branches usually in forks,
  &frac14; in. in diameter, three-angled; angles wavy or slightly
  notched, grey-green. Flowers small, produced in spring in the notches
  of the angles, white. Fruit a white berry. A thin, Brazilian plant,
  not unlike a Lepismium, but without the silky hairs in the notches of
  the angles. This species also requires to be grown in stove
  temperature.</p>

  <p>HE difficulty experienced by amateurs in procuring plants of many
  kinds of Cactus has suggested to us that a list of some of the
  principal dealers in these plants would prove of service to English
  growers. So far as we know, there is no nurseryman in England who
  makes a specialty of Cactuses. Plants of such well-known genera as
  <i>Epiphyllum, Phyllocactus,</i> and <i>Cereus</i> in part, may be
  obtained in England, but for a collection of representative kinds we
  must perforce apply to Continental nurserymen. The most reliable of
  these for Cactuses are:</p>

  <h2>SPECIES INDEX</h2>
  <hr />

  <p>Species are listed alphabetically according to Watson's
  nomenclature. The name(s) that is more likely to be recognised by
  modern readers is listed in brackets. I have used Anderson's
  book&mdash;<i>The Cactus Family</i> (Timber Press, 2001)&mdash;as my
  main guide. Monographs by Craig and by Pilbeam were invaluable in
  identifying 'Mamillarias'.</p>

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

opportunities to fix the problem.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
